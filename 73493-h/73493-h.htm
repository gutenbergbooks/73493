<h2 class="nobreak">PREFACE</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE work of the provincial printers, stationers and
bookbinders forms a subject of the greatest interest,
and one which has hitherto hardly received
adequate attention.</p>

<p>The presses of the two University towns, Oxford
and Cambridge, have been very fully treated, and, in
a lesser degree, those of St Alban’s and York, but with
these exceptions the remaining towns have been curiously
neglected, and our knowledge concerning such
important printing centres as Ipswich, Worcester and
Canterbury seems to have advanced but little since
Herbert issued the third volume of his Typographical
Antiquities over a hundred and twenty years ago. The
period during which these three cities possessed printing
presses was an eventful one in England owing to
religious and political troubles, and it is probable that
among the many anonymous and secretly printed books
issued at that time, a certain number were produced
in the provincial towns.</p>

<p>There is still much to be learned about these provincial
presses. The careers of the printers, their types,
their woodcuts, their ornaments have still to be traced,
and a number of books which have disappeared within
recent years remain to be rediscovered.</p>

<p>For the benefit of anyone desiring to follow up the
subject more fully two appendices have been added to
the present book. The first contains a title list of all
the provincial books issued during the period, with an
indication of the libraries where they are preserved;
the second, a list of bibliographical works and articles,
general and particular, dealing with the provincial
press.</p>

<p>My thanks are due for permission to have facsimiles
made from books in their charge to the Warden and
Fellows of New College, Oxford, the Master and
Fellows of Magdalene College, Cambridge, and to the
authorities of the British Museum and the Cambridge
University Library.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">LECTURE I.</h2>
</div>

<p class="c">OXFORD.</p>


<p><span class="smcap large">In</span> the two series of lectures that I had the pleasure
of delivering in Cambridge as Sandars Reader in 1899
and 1904, I dealt with the printers, stationers, and
bookbinders of Westminster and London from 1476
to 1535, the period from the introduction of printing
into England by William Caxton to the death of his
successor, Wynkyn de Worde. In the present series
I propose to turn to the provincial towns and trace the
history of the printers, stationers, and bookbinders who
worked in them from 1478, when printing was introduced
into Oxford, up to 1557.</p>

<p>I have extended the period to 1557, because in that
year a charter was granted to the re-formed Company
of Stationers, and in this charter was one very important
clause, “Moreover we will, grant, ordain, and constitute
for ourselves, and the successors of our foresaid queen,
that no person within this our kingdom of England, or
dominions thereof, either by himself, or by his journeymen,
servants, or by any other person, shall practise or
exercise the art or mystery of printing, or stamping
any book, or any thing to be sold, or to be bargained
for within this our kingdom of England, or the dominions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
thereof, unless the same person is, or shall be, one of
the society of the foresaid mystery, or art of a stationer
of the city aforesaid, at the time of his foresaid printing
or stamping, or has for that purpose obtained our
licence, or the licence of the heirs and successors of
our foresaid queen.”</p>

<p>The effect of this enactment was virtually to put
an end to all provincial printing, and with the exception
of a few Dutch books, printed under a special privilege
at Norwich between 1566 and 1579, and a doubtful
York book of 1579, no printing was done outside
London until 1584-5, when the Universities of
Cambridge and Oxford once more started their presses.</p>

<p>Within the period I have chosen, printing was
exercised in ten towns, and the presses fall roughly
into three groups. The first contains Oxford, St
Alban’s, and York, the second Oxford’s revived press,
Cambridge, Tavistock, Abingdon, and the second St
Alban’s press, and the last group Ipswich, Worcester,
and Canterbury. Besides these there are one or two
towns which, while not having presses of their own, had
books specially printed for sale in them, as for example
Hereford and Exeter, where the resident stationer
commissioned books from foreign printers. And lastly,
there must be noticed the places which have been
claimed as possessing a press on account of false or misleading
imprints, such as Winchester and Greenwich.</p>

<p>The first book issued from the Oxford press, the
<i>Expositio in symbolum apostolorum</i>, a treatise by
Tyrannius Rufinus on the Apostles’ Creed, was finished
on the 17th of December 1478. By an error of the
printer an x was omitted from the figures forming the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
date in the colophon, and thus the year was printed as
m.cccc.lxviii. [1468] in place of m.cccc.lxxviii. [1478],
and round this false date a wonderful legendary story
was woven some two hundred and fifty years ago.</p>

<p>In 1664 a certain Richard Atkyns published a
tract, entitled <i>The Original and growth of Printing</i>,
written to prove that printing was a prerogative of
the Crown. To strengthen his case he quoted this
Oxford book, produced, as he claimed, much earlier
than anything by Caxton, and also told a wonderful
story of the introduction of printing into England, said
to have been derived from a manuscript in the archives
at Lambeth Palace.</p>

<p>According to this account, Thomas Bourchier, Archbishop
of Canterbury, having heard of the invention of
printing at Haarlem, where John Gutenberg was then
at work (a strange fact which might simplify the
researches on early printing!), persuaded Henry VI. to
endeavour to introduce the art into England. For this
purpose, Robert Turner, an officer of the Robes, taking
Caxton as an assistant, set out for Haarlem, where,
after infinite trouble and considerable bribery, a workman
named Frederick Corsellis was persuaded to
return with them to England. On his arrival he was
sent under a strong guard to Oxford, and there set up
his press, under the protection of the King.</p>

<p>It is needless to say that the whole story is a
fabrication, and a curiously clumsy one. At the
beginning of 1461 Henry VI. was deposed by Edward,
so that these events must have taken place in or before
1460, and it is strange, with all the materials ready,
nothing should be done for nearly ten years. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
information about Gutenberg, who invented printing at
Mainz and was never outside Germany, being engaged
at printing in Haarlem, is preposterous. Lastly, no
trace of the documents has ever been found. It is
strange how Atkyns should have fixed on the name
Corsellis for his mythical printer, for this uncommon
name was that of a family of wealthy Dutch merchants
settled in London at the time. Just ten years after
the publication of Atkyns’ book, a Nicholas Corsellis,
lord of the manor of Lower Marney, Essex, was buried
in the church there, and on his tomb are some verses
beginning,</p>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Artem typographi miratam Belgicus Anglis</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Corsellis docuit.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>


<p>Are we to infer from this that the family was a party
to the fraud?</p>

<p>The story, however, was revived about the middle of
the eighteenth century, when Osborne, the bookseller, in
his catalogue of June 1756 offered for sale an edition of
Pliny’s Letters, printed by Corsellis at Oxford in 1469.
In his note he added that the printer had produced
other works in 1470, and that fragments of a Lystrius
of this date were known. Herbert continues the story
as follows: “This raised the curiosity of the book
collectors, who considered this article as a confirmation
of what R. Atkins had asserted about printing at Oxford.
They all flocked to Osborne’s shop, who instead of the
book, produced a letter from a man of Amsterdam filled
with frivolous excuses for not sending them to him.
They were disappointed, and looked on the whole as a
Hum; however, the <i>Plinii Epistolæ</i> and <i>G. Lystrii
Oratio</i> afterwards appeared at an auction at Amsterdam<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
and were bought for the late Dr Ant. Askew, and were
sold again at an auction of his books by Baker and
Leigh in Feb. 1775.”</p>

<p>These two books passed apparently to Denis Daly,
then to Stanesby Alchorne, afterwards to Lord Spencer,
and are now in the Rylands Library. The forgeries
were made by a certain George Smith, much given to
that class of work, and passed on to Van Damme, a
bookseller of Amsterdam, who sold the Pliny to Askew
for fifteen guineas. The inscriptions in the books
are the clumsiest forgeries, which could not deceive
anyone, while the books themselves were apparently
printed at Deventer, early in the sixteenth century, by
a well-known printer, Richard Paffroet. Listen now to
the remarks of the erudite Dr Dibdin in the Bibliotheca
Spenceriana. “Meerman has a long and amusing
note concerning Van Damme and George Smith, from
which it would appear that the latter had imposed upon
the bookseller, Van Damme, in the annexed subscription
to the volume, and that Van Damme acknowledged the
imposition to one Richard Paffraet of Deventer. If this
be true, the Dutch bibliopole acted a very dishonest
part in selling the volume to Dr Askew for fifteen
guineas!” If instead of long arguments about the types
of the books or the probabilities of the dates, they had
considered the books themselves, it might surely have
occurred to them that it was at least unlikely that the
physician, Gerard Lystrius, a friend and contemporary
of Erasmus, should have published a work in 1470,
while the next work issued by him did not appear until
1516. Besides the forged imprint, the Lystrius has at
the end a long spurious note in Dutch purporting to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
written by J. Korsellis in 1471, stating that the book
had been sent him by his brother, Frederic Corsellis,
from England. In order to kill two birds with one
stone, the writer drags into the note the mythical
inventor of printing, Laurens Janszoon Coster.</p>

<p>Oxford’s claim to having introduced printing into
England was first disputed by the Cambridge University
librarian, Dr Conyers Middleton, in his <i>Dissertation on
the Origin of Printing</i>, published in 1735. He originated
the theory that a numeral x had fallen out of
the date or been accidentally omitted, and, after citing
several early examples of such a mistake, continued:
“But whilst I am now writing, an unexpected Instance
is fallen into my hands, to the support of my Opinion;
an Inauguration Speech of the Woodwardian Professor,
Mr Mason, just fresh from our Press, with its Date
given ten years earlier than it should have been, by the
omission of an x, viz. <span class="allsmcap">MD</span>ccxxiv., and the very blunder
exemplified in the last piece printed at Cambridge,
which I suppose to have happen’d in the first from
Oxford.” Middleton also brought forward what has
remained the strongest argument against the authenticity
of the date, the occurrence in the book of
ordinary printed signatures, which are found in no
other book until several years later. Finally, he pointed
out the very great improbability of the interval of
eleven years between the book of 1468 and the two
books of 1479. The last person to cling to the 1468
date, doubtless from a sense of duty, is Mr Madan of
the Bodleian. In his exhaustive work on the early
Oxford press, after having fully put forward the
arguments for and against, he sums up the situation as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
follows: “The ground has been slowly and surely
giving way beneath the defenders of the Oxford date,
in proportion to the advance of our knowledge of early
printing, and all that can be said is that it has not
yet entirely slipped away. It is still allowable to
assert that the destructive arguments, even if we
admit their cumulative cogency, do not at the present
time amount to proof.”</p>

<p>Another earlier writer on this question ought to be
mentioned, Samuel Weller Singer, since he wrote a
small book entirely confined to the question of the
authenticity of the date. It was entitled “<i>Some account
of the book printed at Oxford in 1468. In which is
examined its claim to be considered the first book printed
in England.</i>” A small number of copies were privately
printed; and the author came to the conclusion that,
in his own words, “The book stands firm as a monument
of the exercise of printing in Oxford, six years older
than any book of Caxton’s with date.” Singer is said
to have changed his views on the subject later on, and
to have called in and destroyed as many copies as
possible. His book may be classed as a curiosity for
another reason. The original issue was said to consist
of fifty copies privately printed, and as many copies as
possible were afterwards destroyed by the author, yet
it is a book of the commonest occurrence in secondhand
catalogues.</p>

<p>The researches of later years, carried out more
scientifically, have produced some definite information.
In the first place, the source of the type in which the
book is printed has been ascertained. It was used in
1477 and 1478 at Cologne by a printer named Gerard
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>ten Raem, who printed five books with it; a <i>Vocabularius
Ex quo</i> issued in October 1477, two issues of a <i>Modus
Confitendi</i> published in January and October 1478 and
a <i>Donatus</i> and <i>Æsopus moralizatus</i>, both without date.
These books are very rare; the only one in the British
Museum or Bodleian being the <i>Donatus</i>. The Rylands
Library contains the <i>Modus Confitendi</i> with the October
date. The University Library possesses the <i>Modus</i>
of January and the unique copy of the <i>Æsop</i>.</p>

<p>Now not only are the types of the Oxford and
Cologne printers identical, but both men made similar
mistakes in the use of certain capitals, and we find
both in the <i>Modus Confitendi</i> and in the <i>Expositio</i> a
capital H frequently used in place of a capital P. This
must be regarded as more than a mere coincidence and
strong evidence of a connexion between the two
presses. The Oxford printer also printed his capital
Q sideways in his earliest book.</p>

<p>The printing of the Cologne <i>Modus Confitendi</i> was
finished “in profesto undecim millium virginum,” that
is on October 20; that of the Oxford <i>Expositio</i> on
December 17. This gives an interval of eight weeks
between the issue of the two books, a time much too
short to allow of the same printer having produced
both books, even if there were not other reasons
against it. Who then was the printer from Cologne
who introduced printing into Oxford? I think we
are quite justified in believing that he was the
Theodoric Rood de Colonia, whose name is first found
in an Oxford book of 1481. Mr Madan considers it
would be unsafe to assume that Rood was the printer
of the first three books, no doubt because the type<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
in which they are printed disappeared absolutely and
was never used again. But analogous cases are not
unknown. For his first book the St Alban’s printer
used a beautiful type which, except as signatures in
two other books, never appeared again.</p>

<p>It is extremely unfortunate that a source from
which we might no doubt have learnt something about
the introduction of printing into Oxford, and some
details about the first printer, seems irrevocably lost.
This is the volume of the registers of the Chancellor’s
court covering the period between 1470 and 1497. In
the volumes that remain, which contain records of
all proceedings brought before the court, there are
numerous references to stationers, and it may be taken
as another piece of evidence against the 1468 date
that there is no reference whatever to printing or
printers between the years 1468 and 1470.</p>

<p>The two books which followed the <i>Expositio</i> are
a Latin translation of the <i>Nicomachean Ethics</i> of
Aristotle by Leonardus Brunus Aretinus, and a treatise
on original sin by Ægidius de Columna. The first, a
quarto of one hundred and seventy-four leaves, is dated
1479, but no month is mentioned. By this date the
printer had discovered which way up a capital Q should
stand, and we find it always correctly printed, though
some minor mistakes of the <i>Expositio</i> are continued,
such as using a broken lower-case h sometimes for a b
and sometimes, upside down, for a q. The general
printing of the book was however improved, and the
lines more evenly spaced out to the right-hand edge.</p>

<p>The second book, the treatise of Ægidius, <i>De peccato
originali</i>, is dated March 14, 1479, but this date may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
be taken as 1479-80. In this book we find red printing
introduced for the first and last time in an Oxford
book. It is by far the rarest of the early Oxford
books, perhaps on account of its small size, for it
contains only twenty-four leaves, and the three copies
known were all bound up in volumes with other tracts.
The Bodleian copy belonged to Robert Burton and came
to the library with his books; that in Oriel College
Library was in a volume with the <i>Expositio</i> and some
foreign printed quartos, which, though kept together,
was rebound in the eighteenth century. The third
copy, now in the Rylands Library at Manchester, was,
until about thirty years ago, in a volume with the
<i>Expositio</i> and three foreign printed tracts, including an
edition of Michael de Hungaria’s <i>Tredecim sermones</i>, a
book which has at the end a curious sermon containing
a notice of the ceremony of incepting in theology at
Oxford and Cambridge, with a few sentences in English.
The volume had belonged to a certain A. Hylton
in the fifteenth century, and was in its original
stamped binding, a very fine specimen of contemporary
Oxford work. The volume was sold in an auction
about 1883, and the purchaser ruthlessly split up the
volume and disposed of the contents. The two Oxford
books found their way into Mr Quaritch’s hands, who
sold the <i>Expositio</i> to an American collector, while the
Ægidius was bought by Lord Spencer to add to the
fine series of Oxford books at Althorp.</p>

<p>These first three Oxford books form a perfectly
distinct group. In them but one fount of type is used,
and they are without any kind of ornament. It is,
however, quite impossible to suppose that an interval<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
of eleven years separated the printing of the first and
second books. The press-work of the second shows a
slight improvement on the first, but only what the
experience gained in printing a first book would enable
the printer to carry out on a second attempt.</p>

<p>The next group of books, four in number, centring
round the dates 1481 and 1482, are the Commentary
on Aristotle’s <i>De anima</i> by Alexander of Hales, dated
October 1481, the Commentary on the Lamentations of
Jeremiah by John Lathbury, a Franciscan and D.D., of
Oxford, dated July 31, 1482, and two books known
only from fragments, an edition of Cicero <i>Pro Milone</i>,
and a grammar in English and Latin.</p>

<p>These books are mostly printed in a new type,
a peculiarly narrow gothic, of the Cologne school, and
curiously resembling some used a little later by another
Theodoricus at Cologne.</p>

<p>The Alexander of Hales is a folio of two hundred and
forty leaves printed in double columns, and some copies
have a woodcut border round the first page of text.
This was probably an afterthought of the printer, for he
has made no allowance for it in the size of the page, and
the border extends out over two inches beyond the
text, with the inevitable result that no copy, even in
the original binding, has escaped being cut down. This
is the first occurrence of a border in an English book.
The design consists of elaborate spirals of flowers and
foliage, amid which are a number of birds; it is a very
well-designed piece of work, but it was probably
obtained from abroad. At least sixteen copies of this
book are known, and one, in the library of Brasenose
College, is printed upon vellum, but is unfortunately<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
imperfect. A copy purchased for Magdalen College,
Oxford, at the time of its issue, cost thirty-three
shillings and fourpence.</p>

<p>The Lathbury, like the Alexander, contains the
printed border only in certain copies. Altogether
about twenty copies are known, of which four are in
Cambridge. Those in Westminster Abbey and All
Souls College, Oxford, are printed upon vellum, and
the latter is a particularly fine copy in the original
stamped binding. A curious point about it is that
four names occur, signed at the bottom of the leaves
in various parts of the volume. It was considered
at one time that these might be the names of press
correcters, but from comparison with similar sets of
markings in other books, Mr Madan came to the
conclusion that they were those of the persons who
supplied the vellum. It is clear that more copies on
vellum than are known must have been printed, since a
number of fragments have been found in bindings.</p>

<p>The Alexander contains a full colophon stating
that it was printed in the University of Oxford by
Theodoric Rood of Cologne on the 11th of October 1481.
The Lathbury has nothing but the date, the last day
of July 1482.</p>

<p>The Cicero <i>Pro Milone</i> is known only from two
sets of fragments rescued from the bindings of books.
Four leaves were presented to the Bodleian in 1872,
and four other leaves were found later in the library
of Merton College, where perhaps more may still be
discovered. The book was a quarto and was made up
in gatherings of six leaves and probably consisted
of about thirty leaves. A page contains only nineteen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
lines which are widely leaded. Though not found
in other Oxford books, this spacing was not uncommon
in editions of texts without notes printed abroad, and
was intended to afford space to the student to write
glosses over the words.</p>

<p>This edition of the <i>Pro Milone</i> is further interesting
as being the first classic printed in England, the next
being an edition of Terence issued in separate plays
by Pynson between the years 1495 and 1497, followed
after a considerable interval by an edition of Virgil
from the same press. The English printers no doubt
saw that it was quite hopeless to compete with the
cheap and well-printed foreign editions.</p>

<p>The <i>Latin Grammar</i> is known only from two
leaves found in a book-binding, and they were acquired
by the British Museum in 1872. What book they
came from is not known, but in 1871 they were in the
hands of Messrs Ellis &amp; Green, and were described
in the <i>Athenæum</i>. From the frequent references to
Oxford in the text, it has been supposed that the work
was compiled in Oxford. Stanbridge was spoken of
as a probable author, but Bradshaw suggested John
Anwykyll, first master of Magdalen School, who had
been recommended to the founder for his skill in a
new style of grammatical teaching which had met with
general approbation.</p>

<p>After the publication of these four books, the type
with which their text was printed disappears altogether,
but is replaced by one of very similar appearance, and
besides this, two other new founts came into use. This
activity may perhaps be explained by the theory that
Thomas Hunte, the Oxford stationer, had entered into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
partnership with Rood. In the Alexander de Hales
of 1481 we find Rood’s name alone, while in the only
book of the last group which contains a full colophon,
the Phalaris of 1485, the names of both are given.
To Hunte’s influence may perhaps be traced the
acquisition of a fount of type of much more English
appearance, and probably, since it contained a w,
intended for use in English books.</p>

<p>To the years 1483 and 1484 six books may be ascribed.
Two editions of Anwykyll’s grammar, Hampole on Job,
a work on Logic, the <i>Provincial Constitutions</i> of England
with the commentary of William Lyndewode, and a
sermon by Augustine on almsgiving.</p>

<p>The editions of Anwykyll’s grammar may be taken
first, since in one copy we find an inscription showing
that it was bought in 1483. The book consists of two
parts, the Latin grammar, and a supplement containing
sentences of Terence with English translations, known
as the <i>Vulgaria Terentii</i>. The part containing the
grammar is excessively rare. Of one issue one fragment
is known, consisting roughly of half the book, now in
the Bodleian Library. It was originally bound up with
other tracts, and the volume was found along with some
other old books in an attic at Condover Hall, Shropshire,
by Mr Alfred Horwood when engaged in an examination
of family archives for the Historical Manuscripts
Commission.</p>

<p>The other issue is known only from six leaves, all in
Cambridge, three in the University Library, two in
Corpus, and one in Trinity libraries. Two reprints of
the grammar were issued on the Continent, one by
Richard Paffroet at Deventer in 1489, consisting of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
seventy-six leaves, and another at Cologne by Henry
Quentell about 1492, containing sixty leaves. From a
comparison of the various fragments with these foreign
editions certain conclusions may be drawn. Anwykyll
had divided his grammar into four parts, and in the
edition represented by the six Cambridge leaves these
parts were arranged in their proper sequence, one, two,
three, and four. In the edition, however, represented
by the Bodleian fragment, and in both foreign editions,
the parts are arranged, one, three two, four. The last
quire of the Bodleian edition was signed m, and it was
followed by the <i>Vulgaria Terentii</i> signed n to q. The
Cambridge edition of the grammar extended at any rate
to signature n.</p>

<p>Since in reprints the tendency is generally to compress,
it is most probable that the Cambridge edition
was the earlier, a conclusion rendered more likely from
the arrangement of the books in their correct order.
For some reason this order was altered in the fresh
issue, the printing was compressed, and the <i>Vulgaria</i>
printed to go at the end. It would be natural for the
foreign printers to take the most recent issue as their
model, in this case the edition represented by the
Bodleian fragment.</p>

<p>We may conclude then that the first Oxford issue
consisted of Anwykyll’s grammar alone, the second the
grammar re-arranged and compressed, with the <i>Vulgaria
Terentii</i> added as a supplement.</p>

<p>The <i>Vulgaria</i> was, however, certainly sold alone, for
two of the five copies known were bound up with other
tracts and without the grammar in original bindings.
A copy in the Bodleian has an interesting inscription<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
stating it was bought in 1483 by John Green out of
gifts made by his friends.</p>

<p>The work of Richard Rolle of Hampole on Job is
known from four copies, three of which were until quite
recently in the University Library. One of these was
parted with as a duplicate in 1893, and is now in the
Rylands Library at Manchester. The fourth copy, up
to the time unnoticed, appeared in the auction of Mr
Inglis’s books in 1900, when it was bought by Mr
Bennett of Manchester, and passed with his whole library
into the wonderful collection of Mr Pierpont Morgan of
New York. The volume consists of sixty-four leaves,
and the last few pages are taken up with a sermon of
Augustine, <i>De misericordia</i>.</p>

<p>The separately printed <i>Excitatio ad elemosinam
faciendam</i> of Augustine was probably issued about
the same time. Only one copy is known and it was
originally bound in a volume with other fifteenth-century
tracts, two of which are dated 1482 and 1484.
This volume was at one time in the Colbert collection,
which was finally dispersed by auction in 1728, when
the volume was Lot 4912 and sold for one livre ten
sous. It ultimately came to the British Museum,
where it lay for long unnoticed, having been entered
in the catalogue as printed by A. Ther Hoernen at
Cologne, but in 1891 it was recognised as a product
of the early Oxford press, and transferred to the select
cases.</p>

<p>The next book in this group is a work on Logic, or
rather a collection of nineteen logical treatises strung
together to form a systematic work. It is generally
associated with the name of Richard Swineshede from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
the occurrence of his name at the end of the seventeenth
treatise. He was a monk of the Cistercian abbey of
Swineshead in Lincolnshire, and a fellow of Merton
College, Oxford, so that, as is fitting, one of the two
known copies of the book is in Merton Library. The
other copy is in the library of New College. A considerable
number of fragments of this book have been
found used in bindings, and there are odd leaves in the
University Library and in the libraries of Trinity and
St John’s, Cambridge.</p>

<p>The <i>Constitutiones Provinciales</i> with the commentary
of William Lyndewode, Wilhelmus de Tylia nemore, as
he is called in the text, is by far the largest and most
important book issued by the Oxford press, and the
first edition of Lyndewode’s great work. It is a large
folio of three hundred and fifty leaves, printed in double
columns, with forty-six lines of text, or sixty of commentary,
to the column. On the verso of the first leaf,
missing in the majority of copies, is a woodcut of a
doctor seated writing at a desk under a canopy, with
a tree on either side. This represents, however, not
Lyndewode compiling his commentary, but Jacobus
de Voragine at work on the <i>Golden Legend</i>, a book
which the Oxford press appears to have made some
preparations for publishing.</p>

<p>This is the most common of the early Oxford books.
Mr Madan enumerates twenty copies, but others have
since come to light. One copy is known printed upon
vellum. It was purchased at the M’Carthy sale for
one hundred francs, and is now in the Bibliothèque
Nationale. The vellum copy, quoted by Hartshorne, as
in the library of St John’s College, does not exist, though<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
that library possesses two on paper. One copy in
Cambridge, that in the library at Corpus, is worthy
of special mention, as its handsome stamped binding
bears every mark of being the work of Caxton.</p>

<p>In 1485 the Phalaris was issued. This is a Latin
translation by Franciscus Aretinus of the spurious
Letters of Phalaris. At the commencement are some
verses by Petrus Carmelianus, the Court poet, and at
the end an interesting colophon in twelve lines of
Latin verse setting forth that the book was printed
by Theodoric Rood of Cologne in partnership with the
Englishman, Thomas Hunte. It continues that Jenson
taught the Venetians, but Britain has learnt the art
for itself and that in future the Venetians may cease
from sending their books to us since we are now
selling books to others.</p>

<p>It is a curious and amusing coincidence that Jenson
should here be mentioned as introducing printing into
Venice in place of the real first printer, John of Spire,
for Jenson’s often repeated claim to be the first printer
of Venice rests upon exactly the same grounds as the
Oxford printer’s claim to be the first printer in England, a
date in a colophon with a numeral, x, accidentally omitted.</p>

<p>The <i>Decor Puellarum</i> printed at Venice by Jenson,
with the date printed 1461 in place of 1471, led many
early writers to consider him the first printer of Venice
and of Italy, and it is possible that a copy of the book,
having found its way to Oxford, deceived the writer
of the verses in the Phalaris. If in return a copy of
the <i>Expositio</i> could have reached Venice, its “1468”
would have just given it the lead of the first Venice
book, the <i>Cicero</i> of 1469, by one year.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span></p>

<p>Another grammar was printed about this time, the
<i>Doctrinale</i> of Alexander de Villa Dei, with a commentary.
Probably what the Oxford printer issued was
not the complete work but the section <i>De nominum
generibus</i>. Of this book two leaves only are known,
preserved in a binding in St John’s College, Cambridge.
These were first noticed by Henry Bradshaw, who found
also some leaves of the Oxford Anwykyll in a similar
binding in Corpus. When the two books, Hollen’s
<i>Præceptorium</i> printed by Koburger at Nuremberg in
1505, from St John’s, and the <i>Fortalitium fidei</i> printed
at Lyons in 1511, from Corpus, were compared, it was
clear that they must have been bound by the same
binder almost at the same time, for, besides the fragments
of Oxford books found in both, the binder had
used in each fragments of one and the same vellum
manuscript. From the occurrence of these fragments
Mr Gibson has claimed the binding as Oxford work,
but as the fragments were binder’s, not printer’s waste,
that is they were from books that had been in circulation,
no very strong argument can be deduced from
them. I have in my own collection a book bound at
Cambridge by Garrat Godfrey, with his signed roll, of
which the boards are entirely made of fragments of the
Oxford Lyndewode.</p>

<p>After 1485 we hear no more of Rood, but it was for
a time considered possible, if not probable, that he was
identical with another printer named Theodoric, who
printed some books at Cologne in 1485 and 1486 in a
distinctive type remarkably resembling that used by
Rood in the Hales and Lathbury. The supposition had
much in its favour; the types were undeniably alike,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
both being of the same class as that used by Ther
Hoernen, another Cologne printer. The name Theodoricus
again was extremely uncommon. Panzer gives
only three in the fifteenth century, the Oxford and
Cologne printers, and the well-known Thierry Martens,
the printer of the Low Countries. There was no proof,
and there was no direct evidence of any kind, but the
hypothesis was not quite groundless. For some reason,
in a review of Vouillième’s work on Cologne printing,
Proctor fell upon this “myth formed without a particle
of evidence,” as he called it, though it was only from
information in the book reviewed that any new facts
about Theodoric were derived. Vouillième discovered
documents showing that the Cologne Theodoric was a
son of Gertrude Molner, who subsequently married
Arnold Ther Hoernen, and after his death in 1483 or
1484, Conrad von Boppard.</p>

<p>The last book from the early Oxford press was an
edition of the <i>Liber Festivalis</i> or <i>Festial</i>, consisting of
sermons for holy days and certain Sundays of the year,
compiled by John Mirk, prior of Lilleshall in Shropshire.
Though generally spoken of as a mere reprint of
Caxton’s edition, it varies very considerably in the
text, and when Caxton issued a new edition he copied
from this rather than his own earlier version.</p>

<p>This is the only Oxford book which was illustrated,
and the illustrations are very interesting. A series of
eleven large oblong woodcuts occur, and all have been
mutilated by having some two inches cut off the blocks
to allow of their being used on a small folio page. No
other editions of the <i>Festial</i> are illustrated, and Bradshaw
pointed out that these cuts were really part of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
set intended to illustrate an edition of the <i>Golden
Legend</i>. In the Lyndewode, issued about 1483, the
printer had used one of these cuts in a complete state,
so that as early as 1483 he had evidently been considering
the issue of a <i>Golden Legend</i> and had begun to
make preparations. But Caxton in London was at
work on the same book, and, finishing his translation in
November 1483, no doubt issued his volume early in
1484. From his prologue we learn that the labour and
expense of production were so heavy that he was “halfe
desperate to have accomplissed it”; and we can quite
understand the Oxford printer hesitating to embark
upon a rival edition of a book so expensive to produce,
and with which the market had just been supplied.
The smaller illustrations belong to a set made for a <i>Book
of Hours</i>, but no edition containing them is known to
exist.</p>

<p>In this book occurs also the only woodcut initial
letter used at the press, a very roughly cut G without
any ornament. Though of the very poorest appearance,
it was used with considerable frequency; for it is found
between fifty and sixty times at the usual commencement
of the sermons “Good men and women.”</p>

<p>Four copies of the book are known. Two in the
Bodleian, very imperfect, and one in the Rylands
Library wanting the first two leaves. The finest is at
Lambeth, which wants only the last, blank, leaf.</p>

<p>The printing of the book was finished in 1486, “on
the day after Saint Edward the King,” presumably
March 19; but there is nothing to show whether this
would be the year 1486 or 1487 of our reckoning. The
only other provincial press of the fifteenth century,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
that of St Alban’s, stopped also in 1486, but so far no
good reason has been suggested for this simultaneous
cessation. That it was due to any political or religious
motive, as is sometimes stated, is very improbable; the
growing foreign competition seems a more reasonable
cause.</p>

<p>From the very earliest times there appear to have
been two classes of stationers in Oxford, those who
were sworn servants of the University, and those who
worked independently. A deed of 1290 shows that
the parchment makers, illuminators, and text writers
were in the jurisdiction of the Chancellor of the
University, and in 1345 the Chancellor was acknowledged
to have jurisdiction over four official stationers.
A most interesting deed of 1373 sets forth that “There
are a great many booksellers in Oxford who are not
sworn to the University; the consequence of which is,
that books of great value are sold and carried away
from Oxford, the owners of them are cheated, and the
sworn stationers are deprived of their lawful business.
It is therefore enacted that no bookseller, except the
sworn stationers or their deputies, shall sell any book,
being either his own property or that of another, exceeding
half a mark in value, under pain of, for the
first offence, imprisonment, for the second, a fine of
half a mark, for the third, abjuring his trade within the
precincts of the University.” The university stationers
in their official capacity had to value manuscripts
offered as pledges for money advanced, they seem also
to have supplied books to the students at a fixed
tariff, and acted as intermediaries between buyer
and seller when a student had a book to sell. For<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
these duties they received an occasional fee from the
University.</p>

<p>At the time when printing was introduced, we find
the same two classes, the University stationers, almost
always Englishmen, and the unofficial booksellers and
bookbinders, mainly foreigners.</p>

<p>The most important stationer in the fifteenth
century was Thomas Hunte, who, we have seen, was
for a time a partner with Theodoric Rood the printer.
His name first appears in 1473, in which year he sold a
Latin Bible, now in the British Museum, and he was
then one of the official University stationers. Between
1477 and 1479 he was living in Haberdasher Hall in
the parish of St Mary the Virgin. These premises in
Cat Street belonged to Oseney Abbey and seem to
have been a favourite situation with stationers. In
1479, besides Hunte, a bookbinder, Thomas Uffyngton,
who bound for Magdalen College, also resided there.
After the appearance of Hunte’s name in the Phalaris of
1485 we find no further mention of him, but his widow
was occupying the same premises in 1498.</p>

<p>Another stationer who visited Oxford and was
apparently connected with it was Peter Actors, a native
of Savoy. On a leaf used in the binding of a French
translation of Livy in the Bodleian is a list of books
which he and his partner, John of Aix-la-Chapelle, left
with Thomas Hunte on sale or return in 1483. His
headquarters, however, must have been in London, for
in 1485 he was appointed Stationer to the King. It is
thus mentioned in the <i>Materials for a history of
Henry VII.</i>, “Grant for life to Peter Actoris, born in
Savoy, of the office of stationer to the King; also<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
licence to import, so often as he likes, from parts
beyond the sea, books printed and not printed into the
port of the city of London, and other ports and places
within the kingdom of England, and to dispose of the
same by sale or otherwise, without paying customs, etc.,
thereon and without rendering any account thereof.”
Richard III., in an act of 1484, had given special
encouragement to foreigners for bringing books into
this country or for settling here as booksellers, binders
or printers, and there is every evidence that this
facility was freely taken advantage of. From the
two or three rather conflicting entries relating to the
grant to Peter Actors, it is not quite clear whether his
appointment was made originally by Richard III. and
confirmed by Henry VII. after his accession, or whether
it originated with the latter. At any rate from the act
and from this appointment we have definite evidence
that both kings looked with favour on the book-trade
and encouraged it by all means in their power.</p>

<p>The son of Peter Actors, Sebastian, certainly lived in
Oxford in the parish of St Mary the Virgin, and was a
stationer and bookbinder. In the University archives
is the record of a grant of administration after his
death dated April 23, 1501. In this a claim is made
by a John Hewtee, who had married his sister Margaret,
on behalf of her father, Peter Actors, for the tools used
in binding.</p>

<p>Among the binding material belonging to the
father we may probably include three panel stamps
of which impressions are known. Two of them are
ornamented with spirals of foliage and flowers enclosing
fabulous animals in the curves, while in the centre<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
are two dragons with their necks entwined. Round
one of these panels runs the inscription, “Ho mater dei
memento Maistre Pierre Auctorre,” while the other has
an inscription in French, but no binder’s name. The
third panel has a conventional acorn design upon it
without any inscription. So far we have not traced
these panels to a date early enough for them to have
been used by Sebastian Actors, but about 1520 they
are used in conjunction with other tools found on
Oxford work.</p>

<p>Another stationer, George Chastelain, is first mentioned
in the imprint of a grammar printed by Pynson
about 1499, “Here endeth the Accidence made at the
instance of George Chastelayn and John Bars.” There
is no indication where he was then at work, but in
1502 he was admitted as a servant to the liberties of
the University. About 1507 Pynson printed for him
an edition of the <i>Principia</i> of Peregrinus de Lugo, an
extremely rare book, of which, however, there is a
copy in the University Library. In this his address is
given as the sign of St John Evangelist in the street
of St Mary the Virgin. He was a bookbinder as well
as a stationer, and in the registers of Magdalen College
frequent mention is made of him between 1507 and
1513 as binding books for their library. He died in
1513, and his will was administered by Mr. Wutton
and Henry Jacobi, a stationer. An inventory of his
goods was made by Howberch, a University stationer,
and Richard Pate, and the value returned at £24.</p>

<p>Some time between 1512 and 1514 a stationer
named Henry Jacobi migrated from London to
Oxford. From 1506 to 1508 he had been in partnership<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
with another bookseller named Joyce Pelgrim,
and assisted by a wealthy London merchant named
Bretton they issued several books together. Between
1509 and 1512 Jacobi published books alone, though
he appears to have still been helped by Bretton.</p>

<p>One book is known printed for Jacobi at Oxford,
an edition of the <i>Formalitates</i> of Antonius Sirectus.
An imperfect title-page and a few leaves were found
by Proctor in the binding of a book in New College
Library, and shortly afterwards a copy of the book,
wanting a greater part of the title, was identified in
the British Museum. It is a quarto of twenty-two
leaves, and was printed in London by W. de Worde.
On the title-page is the very finely engraved device of
Jacobi, probably newly cut, and found in no other of
his books, though it was used again in a mutilated
state by his successor; and below the device an imprint
stating that the book was to be sold in the University
of Oxford at the sign of the Trinity, by Henry Jacobi,
a London bookseller. His shop in London in St Paul’s
Churchyard had also the sign of the Trinity. Jacobi
made his will on September 8, 1514, and died shortly
after. On November 9 his wife renounced her executorship,
and administration was granted to William
Bretton, the rich merchant who had assisted him
throughout his career. On December 11 administration
of the effects of Jacobi was granted at Oxford
also to Bretton through his agent, Joyce Pelgrim,
Jacobi’s former partner.</p>

</div>

<p>The most interesting figure among the early Oxford
stationers is undoubtedly John Dorne or Thorne. In
1507 he was a printer at Brunswick, and printed an
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>edition of the grammar of Remigius entitled <i>Dominus
que pars</i>, the first book to be printed in that town. In
1509 he printed an edition of the <i>Regimen Sanitatis</i>,
and with this second book his career as a printer seems
to have ended. Later he moved as a bookseller to
Oxford, and a valuable memorial of his stay there is
preserved in the shape of his day-book or ledger for
the whole year 1520. This curious little manuscript is
in the library of Corpus Christi College, Oxford, and
was for long erroneously catalogued as a catalogue of
books in the monastery of St Frideswide. Its great
interest remained unrecognised. Dibdin was shown it
on a visit to Oxford, but as might be expected failed to
see its value and took no further notice of it. Coxe, in
his catalogue of manuscripts preserved in college
libraries, gave a correct account of it in 1852, and
finally in 1885 it was admirably edited by Mr Madan
and published in the Collectanea of the Oxford
Historical Society. At the end of January 1886 a
separate copy was sent to Henry Bradshaw, who
immediately set to work upon it, and on the 4th of
February he sent to Mr Madan a thin bound folio
volume of notes, to which he had prefixed a title-page,
“A Half-Century of Notes on the Day-book of John
Dorne.” This was the last piece of work which
Bradshaw finished, and within a week of sending it he
was dead.</p>

<p>Dorne’s ledger throws full light on the trade of an
unprivileged stationer in a University town. His
supply of books necessary for the schools was small.
These no doubt would be mostly bought from the
licensed University stationer; but all other classes are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
well represented. Of liturgical books he sold a very
large number, and naturally the various works of
Erasmus were in great demand. The number of
English books sold was relatively small, though there
are frequent entries of single sheets, almanacks, and
ballads. Such cheaper and popular stock would find a
ready sale when he set up his stall at the St Austin’s
and St Frideswide’s fairs. Towards the end of May
when business was quiet after St Austin’s fair, he went
abroad for a couple of months, presumably to arrange
for the supply of fresh stock, though his absence did
not coincide with the time of the Frankfurt fair. The
ledger begins again on August 5, “post recessum
meum de ultra mare.” In October came St Frideswide’s
fair, when he sold books to the amount of £17, 9s. 6d.
as against the £14, 4s. 10d. which he received at the
St Austin’s fair in May. Probably during fair time he
would have to close his ordinary shop, and transfer his
business for the time to a stall in the precincts of the
fair itself.</p>

<p>Besides being a bookseller, Dorne was also a
publisher on a small scale. An edition of the <i>Opus
Insolubilium</i>, a book used in the schools at Oxford, and
printed by Peter Treveris at Southwark for I. T., has
been known for some time from a copy in the library
of Corpus Christi College, Oxford. The I. T. was
considered to stand for John Thorne, the English form
of Dorne. This has been confirmed by a recent
discovery. From the sale in 1906 of the library of
the Duke of Sutherland at Trentham Hall, a most
interesting volume was secured for the University
Library. It contained three tracts connected with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
Oxford. The first was the <i>Libellus Sophistarum</i> printed
at London by Wynkyn de Worde, of which there were
several editions. The second was another copy of the
<i>Opus Insolubilium</i> mentioned above; but the third was
an entirely unknown book, an edition of the <i>Tractatus
secundarum intentionum logicalium</i>. This has a clear
imprint starting that the book was to be sold by John
Thorne in the year 1527. At the end of the last two
pieces is the device of the printer, Peter Treveris.
We find frequent entries of these two books in Dorne’s
ledger of 1520, so that evidently, finding the sale so
good, he determined to have editions printed for
himself. It is only from this recent discovery that we
are able to attach the date of 1527 to these books
printed at Oxford, but this fits in most curiously with
an assertion made by the Oxford antiquary, Anthony a
Wood. Herbert, in his account of Treveris, wrote: “Mr
Wood thought he had printed a Latin grammar of
Whitinton’s at Oxford in 1527 as also books about
and before that time, but we have not met with any
such.” Wood does not speak of any other books
except the edition of Whitinton’s grammar, and from
his giving the exact date we must either conclude that
he was referring to a genuine book which he had seen,
or else had seen a copy of this book printed for Dorne
and had confused it with some other tract. Wood is
also responsible for the assertion that Wynkyn de
Worde printed for a while in Oxford, and asserts that
a lane called Grope Lane had its name altered to
Wynkyn Lane as a memorial of his work there. For
this statement there seems no foundation, but it is
quite probable that W. de Worde had more considerable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
dealings with the Oxford stationers than we know at
present. He printed a book for Jacobi, to which I
have already referred, and when the press was restarted
at Oxford in 1517 he supplied some of the material.
So much new information has come to light recently
about the Oxford book-trade, that we may fairly hope
for more, and perhaps discover further dealings there
of De Worde.</p>

<p>From the twelfth century onward Oxford appears
to have been a great centre of book-binding, not only
as the seat of a University, but from the number and
importance of the religious houses in its immediate
neighbourhood. From various records and registers
we get the names of individual binders in an unbroken
series. While we can point to exquisite bindings
produced at London, Durham, and Winchester as early
as the twelfth century, and while doubtless similar
fine bindings were produced in Oxford, yet strangely
enough and very unfortunately we cannot point to any
definite specimen of a decorated Oxford binding earlier
than the second half of the fifteenth century. From
about 1460 to the end of the century, on the other
hand, examples are plentiful, and the bindings of this
period have a very distinctive style of their own. The
old styles of binding seem to have lingered on in
Oxford and even some of the old tools.</p>

<p>The earliest binding which we can definitely point
to as executed there is on a volume of sermons written
in 1460. The decoration consists of stamps arranged
as parallelograms one inside the other and covering the
main part of the side. One of the stamps used on this
binding, depicting a strange bird, is the identical stamp<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
found on a twelfth-century binding in the British
Museum. On the back are found small roundels
arranged in sets of three, an ornament very common
on all early Oxford bindings, and a single stamp on
which the three roundels are engraved seems peculiar
to Oxford work. Three manuscripts in Magdalen
College, Oxford, written and bound between 1462 and
1470, are of similar early style, and might from their
appearance and dies be considered two centuries older.
The advent of Rood in Oxford agrees in point of time
with the introduction of a class of binding very
distinctive in style. The centre of the side contains a
panel composed of horizontal rows of stamps and
enclosed by a frame formed with an oblong stamp of
foliage twined round a staff. On spaces outside the
frame are stamped roses and roundels in sets of three.
The stamps employed on these bindings show a distinct
foreign influence, and many of them are almost identical
with those used by foreign binders notably of the Low
Countries. Some bindings, certainly produced in
Oxford about this time, have not only foreign dies upon
them but have them disposed in quite a foreign style,
and are probably the work of foreign binders settled
in the town. The number of different dies used on
Oxford bindings, between 1480 and 1500, is very large.
Gibson, in his work on the subject, gives drawings
of nearly a hundred; and though some of these are
of the simplest character and in no way distinctive,
many of them are both clever in design and extremely
well engraved.</p>

<p>One or two Oxford bindings of the time show a
curious return to another early English style in which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
the ornament was disposed in circles or part of circles.
The finest example is on the Lathbury in the University
Library. The centre of each side is ornamented with
a circle formed by the repetition of a die depicting two
birds drinking from a cup. This die was evidently
cut for use in this special way, for the top is wider than
the bottom, like the stones of the arch of a bridge, so
that when stamped side by side they would work
round into a circular form. Another binding of the
same style is in the library of St John’s College,
Cambridge, and both bear the most extraordinary
resemblance, allowing for the different shape and style
of the dies, to the covers of the Winchester Domesday
book written in 1148 and bound about the same time.</p>

<p>Early bindings fall into three classes, those ornamented
with small dies, in vogue until about the end
of the fifteenth century, panel stamped bindings used
in the early part of the sixteenth, and, finally, the
bindings decorated by a roll tool which begin about
1520. We cannot suppose that the Oxford stationers
did not use panel stamps, but so far none can be
identified as peculiar to Oxford. The panels of Peter
Actoris have been already spoken of, but it is not certain
they were ever used in Oxford. Henry Jacobi, who
came to Oxford from London about 1512 and died in
1514, had certainly various panels which he had used
in London, but he may not have transferred them to
Oxford. Of stationers or binders who lived and worked
in Oxford alone no single panel has yet been identified.
Unfortunately, not a single book printed for or at
Oxford in the early sixteenth century is known in an
original binding.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span></p>

<p>In good specimens of roll-tooled bindings again
Oxford is singularly deficient, in curious contrast
to Cambridge, which rivals if not surpasses London in
this class of work. There are no fine broad rolls, and
only one bearing initials. This is a roll engraved with
a waving spray of foliage containing in the curves the
initials R. H. M. I. What these initials stand for is
unknown, and the roll is only claimed as an Oxford
one from its use on the covers of a Brasenose College
register. For the rest of the century Oxford binding
is entirely uninteresting.</p>

</div>

<p class="c sp">SAINT ALBAN’S, YORK, AND HEREFORD.</p>


<p><span class="smcap large">The</span> only other provincial town besides Oxford which
possessed a printing press in the fifteenth century was
St Alban’s, where an unnamed printer started to work
about the year 1479. As to who the printer was we
have no clue beyond the simple statement made by
Wynkyn de Worde in the colophon of his edition of
the <i>Chronicles of England</i>, “Here endyth this present
cronycle of Englonde wyth the frute of tymes, compiled
in a booke and also enprynted by one somtyme scole
master of saynt Albons, on whoos soule God have
mercy.” The printer is therefore generally known as
the schoolmaster-printer. Sir Henry Chauncy, when
he wrote his history of Hertfordshire, was not to be
deterred by this vagueness from giving this printer a
name, and he appears in that work, and others based
on it, as John Insomuch. The proof is clear. The
printer printed only two books in English. One begins:
“In so muche that it is necessari to all creaturis of
cristen religyon;” the other, “In so much that gentill
men and honest persones.” What further proof could
be wanted that the printer’s surname was Insomuch?
As to the printer’s Christian name having been John,
the arguments would appear to have been less weighty,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
at any rate no authority has condescended to mention
them.</p>

<p>Whoever the printer may have been, he was probably
not a foreigner, at any rate no foreign design can
be traced in his type, which is perhaps modelled on
Caxton’s, though differing considerably. Though as
a schoolmaster he might be supposed to have been
connected with the Abbey, there is no reference to it
in his colophons, which always mention clearly the
town of St Alban’s. The saltire on a shield, which
occurs in his mark, was alike the arms of the Abbey
and of the town.</p>

<p>The first book issued from this press was a small
work of Augustinus Datus, usually called <i>Super
eleganciis Tullianis</i>, of which the only known copy is
in the Cambridge University Library. It is a small
quarto of eighteen leaves and is printed in a peculiarly
delicate gothic letter. It has no date, only the simple
colophon, “Impressum fuit opus hoc apud Sanctum
Albanum.” The type is very graceful and clear; it
looks almost like the production of an Italian workman
copying from a Caxton model, though, as I have said,
we have no reason for supposing the printer to have
been a foreigner. For some reason he seems not to
have been satisfied with it, and so far as we know no
other book was ever printed in it and beyond being
used for signatures in two later books, no further use
was made of it. This first book also stands apart from
the rest in being without printed signatures, which
would at once place it without any further proof at
the head of the list of St Alban’s books.</p>

<p>In 1480 the printer issued his first dated book, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
<i>Rhetorica Nova</i> of Laurentius de Saona, and in this the
influence of another press can be clearly traced. The
printer had discarded his first fount and obtained a new
one with a strong superficial resemblance to Caxton’s
Type No. 2*, the very type which Caxton had used to
print his edition of the same book. There is one
curious point about this book which is rarely met
with, it is partly a quarto and partly an octavo; that
is, it is partly made up from large sheets of paper
folded three times, and partly from small sheets folded
twice. A somewhat similar example may be found in
the <i>Chronicles</i> printed by Machlinia, which is a folio,
with a few pages quarto. This is the most common
of the Latin books issued by the St Alban’s printer,
for at least five copies are known, one of which is in
the University Library.</p>

<p>The other book which the printer issued in 1480 is
printed in another new type, quite the ugliest and most
confusing of English fifteenth-century types, and full of
bewildering contractions. It is an edition of the <i>Liber
modorum significandi</i> of Albertus, and the only known
copy, which had belonged to Tutet and Wodhull, is
now in the Bibliothèque Nationale. Three more books
were printed in this type, Joannes Canonicus on the
<i>Physica</i> of Aristotle, Antonius Andreæ on the <i>Logica</i>,
and the <i>Exempla Sacræ Scripturæ</i>. The first of these
is a folio printed in double columns, and two copies
are known, one in the Bodleian, and the other in the
library of York Minster, while a number of odd leaves
are in the library of Clare College, and a few at Peterhouse.</p>

<p>Of the <i>Antonius Andreæ</i> three copies are known,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
one in Norwich Cathedral, another wanting two leaves
in Jesus College, Cambridge, and the last wanting
eight leaves in Wadham College, Oxford. The
Cambridge and Norwich copies are both in their
original bindings. The signatures in this book are
curious, for the printer, having come to the end of
his first alphabet, continued with contractions and
then signed two more sheets one “est” and the other
“amen.” Bradshaw, comparing the Cambridge and
Norwich volumes side by side, found some variations
pointing to the reprinting of certain sheets. The
<i>Exempla Sacræ Scripturæ</i> is known from two copies,
one in the British Museum, and one said to be in the
Inner Temple Library, though its existence is doubtful.
For a long time the Museum copy was lost sight of.
When Blades began to work on the St Alban’s printer
with a view to writing a preface to the facsimile of the
<i>Book of St Alban’s</i>, he was anxious to see a copy of
this book. Herbert had quoted copies as in His
Majesty’s library and the Inner Temple, but neither
were forthcoming. The authorities in London thought
it probable that the book was in the Bibliothèque
Nationale. In those days there were no special
catalogues of the British Museum Incunabula, or Early
English Books, though as a matter of fact this book
has not been included in the latter, and his researches
were at a standstill. Finally, quite by accident,
Bradshaw found it in the general catalogue, under
the heading, “Bible, Latin, Parts of, Incipiunt.”</p>

<p>The book is a quarto of eighty-eight leaves, the
Museum copy wanting five. It has a plain colophon stating
that it was printed in the town of St Alban’s in 1481.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span></p>

<p>After the issue of these six books within a period
of about two years, the printer seems to have ceased
work for a time. When he recommenced in about three
years, both the character of his work and of the books
he issued had changed. He gave up the printing of
Latin and discarded the very confused type he had
been using previously.</p>

<p>The <i>Chronicles of England</i>, one of the two English
books issued by the St Alban’s printer, is undated, but
is ascribed to the year 1485. It agrees generally with
the <i>Chronicles</i> printed by Caxton, but has histories of
popes and ecclesiastical matters interpolated. The
prologue states that it was compiled at St Alban’s
in 1483, and W. de Worde tells us that it was
compiled and printed by the schoolmaster.</p>

<p>The book is a folio of 290 leaves, and, though at
least twelve copies are known, only one, that in the
library of the Marquis of Bath at Longleat, is perfect.
One copy is known printed upon vellum. It belonged
at an early date to the old family library of the
Richardsons of Brierly Hall in Yorkshire, and passed
by inheritance to Miss Currer of Eshton Hall in the
same county, herself a collector of some note in the
early part of the nineteenth century. It wanted a
leaf and a half, and four leaves, though original, were
printed on paper. On the advice, I believe, of Dibdin,
these four genuine leaves were replaced by facsimiles
on vellum, and the two missing leaves also similarly
supplied. At the Currer sale in 1862 the volume
was sold for £365, and passed later into a private
collection.</p>

<p>For the first time at this press we find red printing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
used for the initials and paragraph marks; there are
also a few diagrams and one small rough woodcut
depicting a jumble of towers, spires, and turrets, and
equally suitable for the two cities which it professes
to represent, London and Rome. At the end is the
printer’s device, Italian in style, a double cross rising
from a circle. In the circle is a shield bearing a saltire
cross, the arms alike of the town and abbey of St
Alban’s.</p>

<p>The last book from this press was the famous <i>Book
of St Alban’s</i>, “the book of hawking and hunting and
also of coat armours.” It is a small folio of ninety leaves.
As might be supposed from its popular nature copies
are now excessively scarce, and out of some dozen which
are known, not one is absolutely perfect. This book
marks another advance in printing, for it contains the
earliest known examples of colour printing in England,
the shields of arms being printed in red, blue, and
yellow inks. About the authorship of this book there
has been much controversy. The middle portion, on
hunting, which is in verse, ends with the words,
“Explicit Dam Julyans Barnes in her book of hunting.”
The authoress has been variously identified with ladies
of very varying degrees, from the high born if somewhat
mythical Juliana Berners, prioress of the nunnery
of Sopwell, down to the lowly dame who wrote it to
instruct the infants who attended St Julian’s school at
St Alban’s, that is St Julian’s bairns!</p>

<p>Of the book of blasyng of arms it is distinctly
stated that it was translated and compiled at St
Alban’s, and it seems to have been derived to a great
extent from a treatise on the subject written by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
Nicholas Upton in 1441, and dedicated to Humphrey,
Duke of Gloucester. Whatever may have been the
share taken by Juliana Berners in the two books of
hawking and hunting they were certainly not original
work, but appear to have been derived in great part
from a fourteenth-century treatise, the Venerie de
Twety. Hawking, hunting, and a knowledge of
heraldry were considered necessary accomplishments,
so that the three treatises were collected and published
in one volume for the education of “gentlemen and
honest persons.” Two types are used in these English
books, the text type, first used in the <i>Laurentius de
Saona</i> of 1480 and then superseded, which is a fairly
close imitation of Caxton’s type 2*, and a larger church
type for headings, used only in the <i>Book of St Alban’s</i>.
This last is identical with Caxton’s type 3, and it is
clear that the printer had obtained from Caxton the
small amount necessary for its occasional use. Far too
much importance has been attached to this appearance
of Caxton’s type at St Alban’s, and a good deal of
nonsense written about the transference of type to St
Alban’s in 1486 and its recurrence in London at a later
date. As Caxton possessed the punches and matrices
and type-moulds, there was nothing simpler than for him
to supply sufficient type to his fellow-worker at St
Alban’s to enable him to vary his page by setting up
his chapter headings in a larger type contrasting with
the text.</p>

<p>A little over thirty years ago a most preposterous
attempt was made in a series of letters published in the
<i>Athenæum</i> to prove that the schoolmaster printer of
St Alban’s was the real printer of many of the books<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
attributed to Caxton at Westminster. A number of
quite irrelevant assertions were made and vague arguments
brought forward of which the following is
apparently the strongest. Because Caxton’s edition of
the <i>Description of Britain</i>, printed in 1480, has not the
place of printing mentioned in the colophon, while some
of the later editions speak of the <i>Chronicles</i> and <i>Description
of Britain</i> as printed by the schoolmaster of
St Alban’s, therefore Caxton’s edition was printed at
St Alban’s. This is surely a quite unwarranted argument
from the fact that W. de Worde preferred to
reprint the St Alban’s edition rather than Caxton’s.
The writer sums up as follows. “Putting all these facts
together they form very strong circumstantial evidence
that Caxton had two presses at work at one and the
same time, at Westminster and St Alban’s; that what
he could not print at Westminster, for lack of time and
space, he had printed for him by this schoolmaster at
St Alban’s, and that all the books of Caxton’s which
bear no date or place come from St Alban’s.” The
writer also asserts that all Caxton’s early books were
printed by him at St Alban’s before he moved his press
to Westminster. One other strange assertion about the
St Alban’s press remains to be noticed. It is both the
newest and the most absurd. Under the article, St
Alban’s, in the latest edition of the <i>Encyclopædia
Britannica</i>, the history of the early press is summed up
in these few lines. “On a printing press, one of the
earliest in the kingdom, set up in the Abbey, the first
English translation of the Bible was printed.”</p>

<p>As at Oxford, the St Alban’s press ceased its work
in 1486 for no reason that we can explain, but most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
probably owing to competition. The Oxford and St
Alban’s printers must both have seen that in Latin
books they could not hope to compete with their
foreign rivals, either in excellence of workmanship or
in cheapness, and each made a final effort by the production
of books in English where foreign rivalry would
not be felt.</p>

<p>Just as at Oxford, too, a second press was at work
for a few years in the sixteenth century, which will be
noticed later; but a period of nearly fifty years elapsed
between the stopping of the first, and the beginning of
the second.</p>

<p>York, both as the leading city in the North of
England and from its ecclesiastical importance, was
from very early times an important centre of book
production. The text writers and illuminators of
manuscripts had formed themselves into a guild as early
as the time of Edward III., while the bookbinders
became a separate company in 1476. Like most of the
leading provincial towns, York was very jealous of
its privileges and made stringent regulations as regards
its trade and business. In 1488 the various crafts
connected with books passed a bye-law enacting that
no person, secular or religious, not franchised or allowed
by the craft, should bring in or set out any work. Poor
priests were allowed to augment their salaries by the
practice of text writing and illumination, and any priest
might write and illuminate books provided they were
for his own use, or to be given away in charity.</p>

<p>York books may be divided into three groups.
1. Those actually printed in York. 2. Those printed
elsewhere but containing a York stationer’s name.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
3. Those printed elsewhere, without a stationer’s name,
but obviously intended for sale in the city.</p>

<p>The earliest book connected with York belongs to
the last group. It is a <i>Breviary</i> for York use, and was
printed at Venice by a well-known printer of such books,
Johann Hamman or Hertzog of Landau in 1493, at the
costs of Frederick Egmont, an English bookseller. The
book is a beautifully printed octavo of 478 leaves,
printed in double columns in red and black. One copy
only is known, now in the Bodleian. It belonged at
one time to Ralph Thoresby, the Yorkshire antiquary,
then to Marmaduke Fothergill, whose widow presented
his library to the Dean and Chapter of York in 1731.
This volume, however, did not reach the Minster library,
but passed into the collection of Edward Jacob, the
antiquary, who died in 1788. At his sale it was bought
by Richard Gough. Gough in his will bequeathed his
topographical collections to the Bodleian, and English
service books being connected with the uses of Salisbury,
York, and Hereford were fortunately classed as topography.
By this means the liturgical collections of the
Bodleian were increased with thirty-nine <i>Missals</i>,
twenty-one <i>Breviaries</i>, twenty-five <i>Horæ</i> and twenty-one
<i>Manuals</i> and <i>Processionals</i> besides <i>Psalters</i>,
<i>Hymnals</i>, <i>Graduals</i>, and other books.</p>

<p>This <i>Breviary</i> is the only book printed for York in
the fifteenth century, yet though text writing seems to
have flourished well up to 1500, the importation of printed
books soon showed the advantage of printing over writing,
and the stationers began to commission service books.</p>

<p>The first York stationer was Frederick Freez, who
was admitted a freeman of the city of York in 1497<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
as a bookbinder and stationer. He may also have been
a printer, for in the records of a lawsuit held at York
in 1510 he is styled “buke-prynter,” and fellow-townsmen
would hardly have called him this without reason.
Nothing printed by him is known, though Herbert
suggests that a proclamation on vellum of the time of
Henry VII. issued at York, mentioned by Bagford,
might have been printed by him. In 1500 he and his
wife, Joanna, were admitted members of the Corpus
Christi Guild. In March 1506 the Corporation passed
an order “that Frederick Freez, a Dutchman and an
alien enfranchised, should dwell and inhabit upon the
common ground at the Rose, otherwise the Bull in
Conyngestrete, for ten years, at three pounds yearly rent.”
Freez is spoken of as a Dutchman, and his proper name
was no doubt Vries or De Vries. For some reason,
perhaps through marriage, the name, Freez, was changed
to Wandsforth, a not uncommon Yorkshire name, and,
though Frederick does not seem to have used it himself,
his brother, Gerard, certainly assumed it, and in his will
calls both himself and his brother Wandsforth, making
no reference to his original name, Freez.</p>

<p>Frederick is but a shadowy person. His name is
found in no colophon, and the only definite connexion
with book-selling of which we have evidence, is the
inevitable lawsuit, for Pynson brought an action against
him in 1505. He was certainly still alive in 1515,
when he is mentioned as living in the parish of St
Helen on the Walls. He is known to have had two
sons, Valentine and Edward. The first took up his
freedom by patrimony in 1539, but he appears soon
after to have fallen a victim, with his wife, to religious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
persecution. Fuller writes of them, “They were both
of them born in the city and both gave their lives
therein at one stake for the testimony of Jesus Christ,
probably by order from Edward Lee, the cruel Archbishop.”
Though Fuller, relying on Foxe, assigns this
event to the impossible date of 1531, the account may
be taken as founded on fact.</p>

<p>The other son, Edward, who, according to Foxe, had
been apprenticed at York to be a painter and was
afterwards a novice monk, was convicted of heresy
at Colchester through painting texts upon the walls
of the inn which he was decorating. He was imprisoned
in London, his wife and child were cruelly killed, and
he himself so barbarously treated that he never afterwards
recovered his wits.</p>

<p>The first York stationer, whose name is found in a
printed colophon, is Gerard Freez, or Wandsforth, as he
more often called himself, the brother of Frederick
Freez. The first book printed for him was an edition
of the <i>Expositio Hymnorum et Sequentiarum</i>, produced
by Pierre Violette at Rouen in 1507. A perfect copy
of both parts is in the John Rylands Library, which
was formerly in the wonderful collection formed by
Richard Vaughan at Hengwrt; an imperfect copy
is in the Bodleian, and copy of the <i>Expositio Sequentiarum</i>
is in the Bibliotheca Columbiniana at Seville.
Though this book is an edition of the ordinary Exposition
of the Hymns and Sequences according to Salisbury
use, yet the words “ad usum Sarum” have been
omitted from the title, perhaps as being considered
prejudicial to its sale in York. On the title-page is
a woodcut of a scholar seated at his desk, and its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
occurrence here in a book with Violette’s name was
the means of identifying the printer of the first book
printed for sale in Scotland, a grammatical treatise by
Joannes de Garlandia, which has the same woodcut
on the title-page. The year previous to printing this
York <i>Expositio</i>, Violette had printed a Sarum <i>Expositio
Sequentiarum</i>, and presumably an <i>Expositio Hymnorum</i>
now lost, for Andrew Myllar at Edinburgh.</p>

<p>About this time editions were also issued of the
<i>Missal</i>, <i>Breviary</i>, and <i>Directory</i> of York use. Of the
<i>Missal</i>, apparently only two copies, both imperfect,
are known. When perfect it consisted of 232 leaves,
with two columns of forty-three lines. The colophon
states that it was printed “impensis honesti viri Petri
Violette,” but Violette was himself the printer, and
his name occurs engraved in the large initial M on
the title-page. The book has no date, but may be
assigned to about 1507, and the copy sold in the
Cholmley sale in 1902 contained the autograph of Dr
Martin Colyns, an official of the court of York who
died in 1509. The other copy known is the fine copy
in the Bodleian, which wants only leaf 117, the leaf
preceding the Canon of the Mass, which would have
contained a woodcut of the Crucifixion. The <i>Breviary</i>
is known from a single copy formerly in the collection
of Mr Blew, and now in the University Library. It
is a small octavo volume containing both parts, the
Pars Hiemalis and the Pars Æstivalis, and, if perfect,
should have filled about 600 leaves. It is, however,
very imperfect, wanting both beginning and end, title-page
and colophon, so that any information which
either might have contained is now lost.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span></p>

<p>Of the last book, the <i>Directorium</i>, no copy is known,
but we know of its existence from documentary evidence
to be referred to later.</p>

<p>On one of his journeys, presumably to sell books,
Gerard Wandsforth was taken ill at King’s Lynn in
Norfolk. There on October 3, 1510, immediately
before his death, he executed his will. He described
himself as a stationer of York, and desired to be
buried within the church of St Margaret before the
chapel of the Holy Trinity at Lynn. He adds the
clause, “Also I require for the love of Jhesu Christ for
to be a brother of the Trinity guild kept there, and to
pay therfor as the custom of the guild requireth.”
To his brother, Frederick, and his brother’s son,
Valentine (there is no mention of Edward), he leaves
legacies. Then follows, “To Richard Watterson of
London xl. s., to the which Richard, Mr Wynkyn de
Word, can inform you. Item I giff to the said Mr
Wynkyn xl. s., which I howght him.” The executors
were his brother Frederick, Ralph Pulleyn, a goldsmith
of York, and Mr Maynard Weywik of London. The
will was proved at York on October 24. As there is
no mention of wife or children, we may presume he
was unmarried. The bequests to Richard Waterson
and Wynkyn de Worde are interesting. We do not
know at present of any Richard Waterson, a stationer
in London, but a Henry Watson, and the names are
easily confused, was at the time an apprentice to W.
de Worde, and we have a reference to another book
not now known, printed at London by Hugo Goes, who
printed later at York, and Henry Watson. The
coincidence of names, though it may not mean<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
anything, is certainly curious. From his owing money
to De Worde we may presume he obtained stock from
him, and we find all the York printers and stationers
had dealings of one sort or another with De Worde.
Ralph Pulleyn, the goldsmith, seems to have acted
towards Wandsforth as Fust did to the first printer
Gutenberg, advancing money to assist him in trade.
The third executor, Mr Mayner Weywik, is passed over
without notice by Davies in the account of the will in
the <i>History of the York Press</i>, but his connexion is
fairly easily explained. In the lists of persons
admitted to the freedom of York in 1529-30 is a
stationer, Johannes Warwyke, son of Edward Warwyke,
merchant. Thus the Warwyke family were connected
with York and also with the business of a stationer.
Mr Mayner Warwyke, who was like Ralph Pulleyn, a
partner with Wandsforth, appears to have renounced
his executorship and sold his share in the business to
Pulleyn. Probably as he lived in London he did not
see his way, after Wandsforth’s death, to continuing in
the business at York.</p>

<p>Shortly after the proving of the will in October
1510, probably at the beginning of 1511, a suit was
brought by Frederick Wandsforth against his co-executor,
Ralph Pulleyn, and the evidence brought
forward throws a considerable amount of light on the
early York book trade. The following abstract of the
proceedings is given by Davies.</p>

<p>“It appears that the testator, Gerard Wandsforth,
his friend Ralph Pulleyn, and another friend Mr
Manard (Mr Mayner Weywick), had made a considerable
purchase of books as co-partners in equal third<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
shares. The books, which, it is stated, were bought in
France, consisted of 252 missals, 399 portifers
(breviaries), and 570 Picas all printed upon paper.
The whole were consigned to the care of Wandsforth,
who deposited them in a room or chamber of his house,
near the church of St John del Pyke at York, of which
chamber Ralph Pulleyn had a key. As soon as the
death of Wandsforth became known at York, Pulleyn
hastened to the house of the deceased and took
possession of all the books deposited there, not only
those which had been bought in partnership, but others
which were the sole property of Wandsforth, and
caused them to be carried to his own house in
Petergate. He alleged he was justified in taking this
course by having advanced money to Wandsforth to
enable him to defray the cost of printing some books
and purchasing others. It was natural that Frederick,
the testator’s brother, should feel much aggrieved by
Pulleyn’s grasping conduct, and upon their encountering
each other in the street of Petergate, near Pulleyn’s
residence, high words passed between them which
ended in an affray. When Frederick charged the
goldsmith with detaining from him the property he
was entitled to as his brother’s executor, and thus
preventing him from paying his brother’s debts and
legacies, and fulfilling the trusts of his will in other
respects, Pulleyn said to him, ‘You shall have your
brother’s goods delivered to you that ever I had of his.’
But when they went together to Pulleyn’s house only
part of the books were offered to be given up, and
these Frederick refused to accept, insisting upon having
the whole. It was then that, to enforce his rights, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
resorted to legal proceedings against Pulleyn. Whilst
the suit was pending, the contending parties were
induced, by the good offices of friends, to agree to refer
all matters in dispute to the arbitration of Sir John
Symson, priest, one of the vicars choral of the
cathedral, and Mr John Scauseby, a gentlemen residing
in Goodramgate, and a formal deed of reference was
executed. The books which had been purchased by
the testator, jointly with Pulleyn and Manard, they
divided into three equal parts and had them valued by
John More, a moneylender, who lived in Walmgate,
whose estimate amounted to the sum of £86, 19s. 8d.
Those belonging solely to the testator, of which Pulleyn
had taken possession, consisted of about 300 volumes,
some bound and some not bound, which were estimated
to be worth about £20. These were chiefly books
used in the services of the church, as Primaria,
Doctrinalia, Hymni et Sequentiæ; with some
Alphabeta, and others, both in Latin and English,
the titles of which unfortunately are not stated. The
award of the arbitrators was in favour of Frederick
Wandsworth, the complainant in the suit. It was
pronounced in the presence of Ursin Milnour, and
three other persons, who are described as laics of the
respective dioceses of Rouen, Durham, and York.”</p>

<p>The original documents of this suit are still preserved
in the registry of the Dean and Chapter of York,
and it is much to be desired that a full reprint of them
might be issued, as it is clear that they contain many
points of interest passed over by Davies in his abstract,
as well as names which might afford valuable evidence.</p>

<p>The books belonging to Wandsforth which are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
mentioned by name are, we have seen, <i>Primaria</i>,
<i>Doctrinalia</i>, <i>Alphabeta</i>, and <i>Hymni et Sequentiæ</i>.</p>

<p>The only trace of an early York <i>Horæ</i> or <i>Primer</i>
now known is an unfolded imperfect quarter-sheet
containing six out of eight leaves of signature P
among the Bagford fragments in the British Museum.
The book was of very small size, a 32º with fourteen
lines to a full page printed in black and red. The
type is apparently Pynson’s, and it is the only known
book printed by him connected with York. But
another proof of his connexion with York has lately
come to light, for there has been found in the Plea
Rolls for 1505 a notice of a lawsuit brought by
Pynson against Frederick Frees, bookseller of York, for
£5, 10s. 6d., perhaps relating to this very book. The
<i>Doctrinalia</i> and <i>Alphabeta</i> were presumably school
books, while the <i>Hymni et Sequentiæ</i> belonged to the
edition already described. The foreign printed books
belonging jointly to the partners consisted of <i>Missals</i>,
<i>Breviaries</i>, and <i>Picas</i>. The <i>Missal</i> and <i>Breviary</i>,
printed at Rouen by Violette, have already been
described, but no copy of a foreign printed York <i>Pica</i>
(or <i>Directorium</i>) is known. An edition, shortly to be
described, was printed in York in February 1509-10,
which is described in the colophon as revised and
amended, and perhaps it was reprinted from the lost
foreign edition. Its competition might account for the
large number (570) remaining of the earlier edition in
the hands of Wandsforth’s executors.</p>

<p>The books actually printed in York are six in
number, and are the work of two printers, Hugo Goes
and Ursyn Mylner. Goes has been conjectured from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
his name to have been related to Matthias van der
Goes, a printer of Antwerp, but for this no proof is
forthcoming. In 1509-10 he printed an edition of the
York <i>Directorium</i>, of which two copies are known, one
in York Minster wanting about fifteen leaves, the
other in the library of Sidney Sussex College wanting
only the last leaf, which would either have been blank
or have contained a printer’s device.</p>

<p>Davies in his <i>History of the York Press</i> has been
singularly unfortunate in his account of this book. He
quotes the very inaccurate transcript of the colophon
printed by Ames, and then adds: “Neither the copy in
the library of Sidney Sussex College nor that belonging
to the Dean and Chapter of York now contains the
leaf upon which this colophon was printed. It is to
the valuable work of Ames that we are indebted for
the only record of it that has been preserved.” Davies
or his informant was probably misled by its occurring
three pages before the end of the book. It gives full
information, stating that the book was printed at York
by Hugo Goes in the street called Steengate on the
18th of February 1509. The work begins with a
preface by Thomas Hannibal, doctor of laws and canon
of York, who, later, brought the golden rose from the
Pope to Henry VIII., praising the edition as revised
and corrected by Thomas Hothyrsall, vicar choral of
the Minster. Then follows another preface in which
it is stated that “the pica with its table which was
composed by Robert Avissede, priest and formerly
chaplain of the church of St Gregory in the great city
of York, will last as long as the world endures.” It
has still 118 years to run.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span></p>

<p>The book is printed with a fount of type which had
belonged to Wynkyn de Worde, and which he had
discarded shortly after 1500.</p>

<p>Besides the <i>Directorium</i> Goes is credited with two
other books, editions of the <i>Donatus Minor cum
Remigio</i> and <i>Accidence</i>. In 1664 Christopher Hildyard,
a barrister in York, issued a little book on the antiquities
of the city, and his own copy with manuscript
additions is now in the British Museum. One of his
notes relates to these books, of which he gives a fairly
full description with the titles and imprints. They
were bound up with a grammar printed by W. de Worde
in 1506. He ends his note thus: “The book I have by
me, new bound up by Mr Mawburn of York, bookseller,
1667, July 12.” Of the Wynkyn de Worde grammar
of 1506, we know of an imperfect copy in the library
at Lambeth, but of the two grammars printed by Goes
in the Steengate, all traces have disappeared. Hildyard’s
description is so clear and exact that there is no
reason whatever for doubting his accuracy, and we can
only hope that they have not been destroyed, but may
be rediscovered some day on some unexplored library
shelf.</p>

<p>What became of Goes is not known, but his name
is connected with another very mysterious lost book.
Amongst the numerous manuscript collections made by
John Bagford, with a view to writing a history of
printing, is the following entry, copied apparently from
a colophon. “Donatus cum Remigio impressus
Londiniis juxta Charing Cross per me Hugonem Goes
and Henery Watson with the printers device H. G.”
Puzzling as this entry is, I think it must be taken as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
representing something which Bagford had seen, for he
was hardly clever enough to invent, if it is a forgery,
so tantalisingly ingenious an imprint. He would not
have known, unless he carefully studied prefaces and
epilogues, that at this time W. de Worde had in his
employment an assistant named Henry Watson, nor
was his eye correct enough to recognise that the type
used by Goes at York was obtained from W. de Worde,
even had he seen a copy of the York <i>Directorium</i>,
which is most improbable. Yet here he combines in
one address as partners two men who had both been
closely connected with Wynkyn de Worde.</p>

<p>Whatever may be said against Bagford, there is no
doubt that he was assiduous, if not always very accurate,
in transcribing titles and imprints of scarce books that
came in his way, and it is from his memoranda that
much information on missing books has been recovered.
Whether Goes worked in London before or after his
sojourn in York, is impossible to determine until some
further information, or the lost <i>Donatus</i> itself, is forthcoming.
The earliest printer, at present known, who
was established near Charing Cross is Robert Wyer,
who was at work as early as 1524. Ames, under H.
Goes, gives the vague entry: “He also printed a Latin
Grammar at London in quarto, formerly among Lord
Oxford’s books,” but this may merely be derived from
Bagford’s notes. Lastly Ames quotes a broadside in
the possession of Thomas Martyn, “A wooden cut of a
man on horseback with a spear in his right hand and
a shield, with the arms of France, in his left. Emprynted
at Beverlay in the Hye-gate by me Hewe
Goes, with his mark or rebus of a great H and a goose.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
Martyn died in 1771, and since his time no trace of this
broadside has been found.</p>

<p>Ursyn Mylner, the second printer in York, has a
much clearer history than his predecessor. He was
born in 1481, but we find no mention of him until
1511, unless he is the Ursyn who supplied some books
for the King’s library in 1502. In 1511 he was a
witness in the lawsuit which we have previously
described. About 1513 he printed two <i>Nova Festa</i> of
York use. The first is an edition of the <i>Festum
Visitationis Beate Marie Virginis</i>, and the colophon
stated that it was newly printed by Ursyn Mylner
dwelling in the churchyard of the minster of St Peter.
This book was chronicled by Ames as in the collection
of Thomas Rawlinson, and again I must add the sad
statement, all traces of it have since been lost. I
searched through Rawlinson’s sale catalogue—sixteen
volumes—without result, but last year in the Bodleian
I came across a note-book among the Rawlinson
manuscripts in which he had entered fairly full notices
of some of his books, and here I found the colophon as
given by Ames. The date of the book can be accurately
settled. In 1513 the Convocation of York ordered the
Feast of the Visitation to be kept as a Festum Principale;
by 1516 Mylner had moved to a new address.</p>

<p>The second of the <i>Nova Festa</i> was a small supplement
to the Sanctorale of the <i>Breviary</i> and the only
copy known, found in the binding of a book, is in the
library of Emmanuel College. The book in which it was
found was printed in 1512, and from the fact that these
leaves, which are printer’s waste, were used in the binding,
this binding may perhaps be attributed to Mylner. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
tract consists of four leaves in 8°, with thirty-three and
thirty-four lines to the page, and commences with a large
initial P printed in colour. The text is in red and black,
and many of the lines end with small type-ornaments.
It is slightly mutilated, but has most of the colophon,
which runs: “Impressum Ebor per me Ursin Mylner
commemorantem in simiterio ministerii Sancti Petri.”
In the colophons to both these <i>Nova Festa</i> we find <i>commemorantem</i>
in place of <i>commorantem</i>. It is probably
the tract referred to vaguely in the introduction to
Wordsworth and Proctor’s edition of the Sarum <i>Breviary</i>
as “An English monastic Breviary supplement, with
anthems and responds for St Thomas and St Edmund of
Canterbury, was printed at York about 1513.” Presumably
their information about it was obtained from
Henry Bradshaw. In the more recently issued book
on the Old English Service Books, York is credited
with no printed <i>Nova Festa</i>.</p>

<p>After printing these two small tracts Mylner
moved to a new workshop. In the lawsuit of 1511 he
was spoken of as living in the parish of St Michael
le Belfry, and the two tracts were printed “in cimiterio
ministerii Sancti Petri,” but both addresses probably
refer to the same place, as the church of St Michael’s
le Belfry stands alongside the minster on the south
side. A small passage adjoining this church, and
forming the south entrance to the minster close, was
formerly known as Bookbinders Alley.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="f3">
<img src="images/fig3.jpg" alt="devices">
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Colophon and Devices from Whitinton’s Grammar, printed<br>
at York by Ursyn Mylner in 1516.</span></p>
</div>

<p>Mylner moved to Blake Street in the parish of
St Helen. It seems probable that his earlier shop,
within the precincts of the minster, would be in the
liberties, and outside the jurisdiction of the municipal
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>authorities, but Blake Street was another matter, and
he would not be allowed to carry on his business as
a printer without having been admitted to the freedom
of the city. In 1515-16, therefore, we find the name
Ursyn Mylner, prynter, entered on the roll of freemen.
He did not obtain his freedom by patrimony, so that
he had probably served his full term of apprenticeship.</p>

<p>In December 1516 he issued a <i>Grammar</i> of
Whitinton. It is a small quarto of twenty-four leaves
and only one copy is known. It was sold in Thomas
Rawlinson’s sale in 1727 for one shilling, being bought
by his brother Richard, and at the latter’s sale it was
bought by M. C. Tutet; it is now in the British
Museum. On the title-page is a woodcut of a schoolmaster
with three pupils seated on a bench before him.
This woodcut originally belonged to Govaert van
Ghemen, who used it at Gouda in an <i>Opusculum
grammaticale</i> printed there in 1486. About 1490,
when he moved to Copenhagen, he parted with some
of his material, and this cut, with a fount of type and
some woodcut initials, passed into the hands of Wynkyn
de Worde, who used it in several grammars issued
about 1500. At the end of the book, below the
colophon, is the printer’s device. This consists of
a shield hanging from a tree supported by a bear,
an allusion to the name Ursyn, and an ass. The
shield is divided per pale, and bears on the one half
a windmill, on the other a sun. The mill is obviously
for Mylner, but what the sun is for is not clear. We
see that Mylner had some connexion with Wynkyn de
Worde, whose sign was the sun; and it is perhaps
just possible that this might refer to some trade<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
partnership between the two men. Below the device
is an oblong cut containing a ribbon in which the name
Ursin Mylner is printed in full. In the centre is his
trade-mark.</p>

<p>In this same year we find him mentioned as a
bookbinder, entered in the accounts of the minster as
paid for binding books for the choir.</p>

<p>After 1516 we find no further mention of Mylner.
He was then only about thirty-five years old and may
possibly have moved elsewhere; but no trace of him
is found. From this time onwards to 1533 almost the
whole York book-trade was in the hands of John
Gachet, a stationer from France. Gachet’s name is
first found in 1509, when, in partnership with another
stationer, Jacques Ferrebouc, he commissioned Wynkyn
de Worde to print for him an edition of the York
<i>Manual</i>. This <i>Manual</i> is a very curious book. The
colophon states clearly that it was printed in London
by Wynkyn de Worde dwelling in the street called Fleet
Street at the sign of the Sun, or in St Paul’s Churchyard
under the image of Our Lady of Pity, for John
Gachet and James Ferrebouc, partners. In spite of
this assertion it is plain that the book was printed
abroad. The paper, the type of the text and music
staves, the illustrations, all are obviously foreign, and
the particular device of De Worde on the title-page is
only found in books printed for him in Paris. The
colophon unfortunately does not state where Gachet
and Ferrebouc were living, but the latter was certainly
just before and after 1509 in Paris. Perhaps Gachet
may have been the travelling member of the firm and
have journeyed as far as York on his business tours.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
By 1514 he was certainly settled there, for in that
year he was admitted a brother of the Corpus Christi
Guild. In 1516 and 1517 he published a series of
service books, a <i>Missal</i>, a <i>Processional</i>, a <i>Manual</i>, a
<i>Hymnal</i>, and a <i>Book of Hours</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Missal</i> is a fine folio of 200 leaves, and there
is a perfect copy with two leaves printed on vellum,
which formerly belonged to Bishop Moore, in the
University Library. Another copy, slightly imperfect,
was given to Pembroke College Library by the Master,
Bishop Launcelot Andrews, in 1589. Besides these, five
other copies are known. The initial M of the word
Missale on the title-page is a very large and elaborate
letter, having a scroll up the centre limb on which is
engraved the printer’s name M. P. Holivier. Similar
ornamental letters containing their names were used
by other Rouen printers, such as Morin.</p>

<p>The <i>Processional</i> is without date, and the colophon
states that it was printed at Rouen by Olivier for
John Gachet, alias de France. A copy of this edition
is at Ripon, and there are perhaps others; but both
Dr Henderson, in his list of York service books, and
Davies have mixed up this edition with the later dated
edition of 1530.</p>

<p>Of the <i>Manual</i>, also undated, only one copy is
known, in the library bequeathed to Dublin by
Narcissus Marsh, the Archbishop. It has no name
of printer, but only the statement on the title that it
was printed for Gachet. The <i>Hymnal</i> is known from
two copies, one in the British Museum, and another
in the library of St John’s College, Cambridge. It
fortunately has a full imprint and colophon stating<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
that it was printed for Gachet by Olivier and finished
on the 5th of February 1517. By an oversight in the
printing of the Museum copy, four pages have been left
quite blank.</p>

<p>After issuing this series of service books Gachet
left York and moved to Hereford, where he published
a book in May, but of his movements during the
next few years we know nothing. Soon after his
leaving York, two Rouen booksellers issued a <i>Missal</i>
and <i>Book of Hours</i>, but in the interval between 1517
and 1526 no York books were issued. In this latter
year Gachet once more appeared at York and published
a <i>Breviary</i>, printed for him at Paris by François
Regnault, the first York book printed at a Paris press,
most of the previous service books having been printed
at Rouen.</p>

<p>Between 1530 and 1533 Gachet issued another
series of service books, two <i>Missals</i>, a <i>Processional</i>, and
a <i>Breviary</i>. A <i>Missal</i> and a <i>Processional</i> were issued
in 1530, and, though neither contains a printer’s name,
they were certainly printed at Rouen. On the title-page
of the <i>Missal</i> is the large M with the name
Holivier engraved upon it, but by 1530 Olivier had
ceased to print, and the book may be ascribed to his
successor, Nicholas le Roux. Three copies are known
of this <i>Missal</i>, two in Oxford and one in Marsh’s
Library, Dublin. One of the Oxford copies was, sometime
in the seventeenth century, bound in two volumes,
with most disastrous results, for now one volume is in
the Bodleian, the other in the library of Queen’s College.
The <i>Processional</i> is an octavo of ninety-six leaves. Both
Dr Henderson and Davies have in their descriptions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
confused this edition with the earlier undated one
issued about 1516. The present has the date 1530
upon the title-page, but contains no name of printer
or place; the colophon merely states that it was
printed for Gachet. The copy in the Bodleian is a
very fine one and contains the signature J. Brooke,
probably Sir John Brooke, the Yorkshire Royalist. It
is in its original binding apparently executed in York,
as the boards are lined with unused sheets of the York
<i>Breviary</i> printed for Gachet in 1526. The British
Museum copy has four quires, that signed F and the
last three, printed in a different type, though the text
agrees page for page with the ordinary copies. In
them the colophon ends, “Impressum expensis honesti
viri Johannis Gachet, in eadem civitate commorantis,”
but in the Museum impression the final words, “in
eadem civitate commorantis,” have been omitted. No
edition is known from which these four quires in the
Museum copy could have been taken. It may be that
the original stock of these sheets was damaged in some
way and reprints made to supply their place, an occurrence
of which several examples are known, otherwise
they are the only remains of an edition now lost.</p>

<p>The last book with a York stationer’s name in the
colophon was a <i>Breviary</i> printed in August 1533 by
Regnault at Paris for Gachet. In the same year
Regnault printed a <i>Missal</i>. This has not Gachet’s
name in the colophon, but was to be sold at Paris in
the Rue St Jacques at the sign of the Elephant,
Regnault’s own address. Regnault had been the most
important printer of English service books, and we
know from a letter written by him to Cromwell in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
1536, that he had a place of business in London from
which he supplied the booksellers. By that time, however,
his trade in such books had almost altogether
disappeared.</p>

<p>Perhaps on account of the restrictions placed upon
alien stationers by the act of 1534, we find among
others taking out letters of denization in 1535 “John
Gachet, alias Frenchman, of the city of York bookbinder,
from the dominion of the King of France,” but
we find no further mention of him as dealing in books,
nor do we know anything of his later career. We
meet, however, with other members of the family. In
1543 John Gachet, Frenchman, of the parish of St
Michael le Belfry, occurs in a list of soldiers sent from
York to Newcastle. If this was a son of our stationer,
he died shortly afterwards, as in 1551 administration
of the effects of John Gachet, son of John Gachet of
York, stationer, dying at Rawcliffe, was granted to
George Gachet, his brother. A William Gachet,
stationer, was admitted to the freedom of the city in
1549-50, and the will of another William Gachet of
York is dated 1551.</p>

<p>The books which had been printed specially for
York booksellers had consisted entirely of service
books, and about 1534 most of these ceased to be
printed, being suppressed or falling into disuse. Thus
though we afterwards find a continuous succession of
stationers at York, no books are known specially printed
for them. The enterprising stationers had all been
foreigners, and foreigners were not viewed with favour
in York or elsewhere at that period. They seem to
have absorbed most of the trade to the detriment of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
the natives, so that we find in 1554 the Company of
Bookbinders and Stationers of York passing a bye-law
that no stranger or foreigner should sell any book or
books within the city, except freemen of the same city.
Earlier acts had prohibited the taking of foreign apprentices,
so that the acts and this bye-law combined
absolutely prohibited any foreigner engaging in the
book trade in the city. The later stationers were all
natives; and if they had energy they did not show it
in the form of commissioning books. When the service
books began to be reissued in Mary’s reign, no York
stationer’s name is connected with them. Of those
that were issued all were printed in London and sold
by London booksellers. Then came the Stationers’
Charter of 1557 and with it the extinction of the
provincial trade.</p>

<p>From the Fabric rolls of York Minster, from the
registers of freemen, and from various other sources, we
obtain the names of a number of bookbinders who
worked at York during the latter half of the fifteenth
and the first half of the sixteenth centuries. A Thomas
Messingham bound books for the Minster in red leather,
probably the bright red deer skin often found at that
period. Frederick Freez is called bookbinder, and
about 1494 Peter Moreaux, another bookbinder, was
made a freeman. John Welles, John Meltynbe and
John Gowthwaite took up their freedom as bookbinders
before 1557, and others, Thomas Newell and
Edward Huby, who were not freemen, are mentioned
in accounts as binders. Unfortunately we cannot
point to any definite bindings as produced by these men,
but it is not improbable that a full and careful examination<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
of the old bindings preserved in the Minster Library
might produce some good results, at any rate this
source of information still remains to be worked. A
late writer on bookbinding, with more daring than
discretion, ascribes one or two marks found on bindings
to York binders. He writes as follows: “G. W., whose
trade-mark occurs on the covers of many books bound
in England, exercised his craft between 1489 and 1510.
Either he or his son was probably associated later on
with another stationer, I. G.; an elegantly designed
stamp bearing both cyphers adorns many bindings executed
between 1512 and 1535. These may perhaps be
the trade-marks of Gerard Freez or Wandsforth, brother
of Frederick, bookseller and binder of York, 1507-10,
and of John Gachet, stationer and bookseller of Hereford
and York, who was still carrying on business in
1535.” This is all futile suggestion. Gerard Wandsforth,
who died in 1510, left no children, and John Gachet
did not come to York until after Wandsforth was dead.
Moreover the mark assigned by this authority to G.
Wandsforth and read as G. W. is by all rules of traders’
marks W. G. If anything is discovered about York
bookbinding, it will not be by this class of idle speculation.
All that can be said is that we know of
numerous York bookbinders, so that very many bindings
were produced there, and no doubt numbers still remain
awaiting identification.</p>

<p>In Gachet’s career as a stationer, a long period, the
nine years between 1517 and 1526, remains unaccounted
for. He had published a series of York service books
in 1516 and 1517, the last, a <i>Hymnal</i>, being dated
February 5, 1517. For some reason he became dissatisfied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
with York, and moved to seek business elsewhere, and
in May 1517 he appears to have been living in Hereford,
where he issued an edition of the <i>Ortus Vocabulorum</i>
with his name in the colophon.</p>

<p>Though printing was not actually practised in
Hereford, three books at least are known which were
printed for sale there. In 1502 the very beautiful
Hereford <i>Missal</i> was printed at Rouen by Pierre
Olivier and Jean Mauditier for a Rouen stationer, Jean
Richard. We know accidentally that about the time this
<i>Missal</i> was printed Richard was in England, for he was
party to a lawsuit at Oxford, and he may have
journeyed to Hereford to dispose of this book. But
though intended for sale in the diocese, the imprint
contains no mention of any local stationer. In 1505
a Hereford <i>Breviary</i> was issued by a stationer named
Ingelbert Haghe, who was under the patronage, as he
expressly tells us in the preface, of that “illustrissima
virago” Margaret, countess of Richmond and Derby, a
generous patroness of printers. Haghe was himself
originally a Rouen stationer, but had come over and
settled in England. On some loose leaves in the
Bodleian originally forming the lining of the binding of
a bible is an inscription stating that the book was
bought from Ingelbert the Hereford bookseller in 1510
about the day of the Lichfield fair. The Hereford
<i>Breviary</i> is a very rare book. The Bodleian has the
Pars Estivalis which came from the Colbert sale. A
copy was in Richard Smith’s sale in 1682, when it was
sold for three shillings and eightpence. This may be
the copy given at the end of the seventeenth century to
Worcester Cathedral Library by Dr George Benson,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
prebendary of Worcester and dean of Hereford. The
third copy known is in private hands. It would seem
that Ingelbert and his patroness Margaret quarrelled over
the production of this book, for in the plea-rolls of 1505,
the year in which it was issued, he is cited as defendant
in a suit brought by Margaret, Countess of Richmond,
the King’s mother, to recover the sum of one hundred
shillings. He is there called stationer and bookseller of
London, so that he may have had a shop in both places.
Unfortunately we have only the mere mention of the
case without any reference to its purpose, but the
coincidence of the date and the known connexion of the
Lady Margaret with the issue of the <i>Breviary</i> make it
probable that it formed the subject of the dispute.</p>

<p>The only other Hereford book known is an edition of
the <i>Ortus Vocabulorum</i>, of which the only known copy,
once in the magnificent collection of Richard Vaughan
of Hengwrt, is now in the Rylands Library, Manchester.
The colophon states that it was printed in 1517 at
Rouen by Eustace Hardy at the costs of Jean Caillard,
a stationer in business at Rouen, and John Gachet
living at Hereford. The copy is quite perfect and in
good condition, and has the further interest of being in
its original stamped binding. After this single venture
we hear no more of Gachet at Hereford, or of anything
being published there.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">LECTURE III.</h2>
</div>

<p class="c sp">OXFORD SECOND PRESS AND CAMBRIDGE.</p>


<p><span class="smcap large">After</span> an interval of about thirty years the Oxford
press restarted on a brief career, this time apparently
with the official sanction of the University. The first
book issued was a commentary by W. Burley <i>Super libros
posteriorum Aristotelis</i>. It is a small tract of ten leaves,
and was finished on December 4, 1517. The printer,
John Scolar, lived in St John’s Street, near Merton
College. Nothing is known of him before he appears
at Oxford as a printer, and nothing of his career in the
University. Mr Madan remarks, “Although Scolar
uses the arms of the University (their earliest occurrence
in print), yet the registers of the University
almost ignore the fact that for the second time the
greatest literary invention since speech and writing
were known was silently at work in its midst.” The
expression “almost ignore” is rather disingenuous.
Whether the registers did or did not ignore John Scolar
we shall never know, since the volume covering the
years from 1515 to 1526 is lost.</p>

<p>The text and notes of this volume are printed in two
sizes of black-letter type, apparently identical with
that used by Wynkyn de Worde. Some of the initials
and the woodcut at the end are certainly his, and it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
would appear as though Scolar had obtained from him
the type which had been used for printing the work
of Sirectus, published a year or two earlier at Oxford
by Jacobi.</p>

<p>The next book, finished on May 15, 1518, is Dedicus’
<i>Questiones super libros Ethicorum Aristotelis</i>. A very
interesting fact about it is the statement on the last
leaf that the printer had a privilege for it for seven
years granted by the Chancellor. No one was to print
it in the University or sell copies printed elsewhere
under pain of confiscation of the books and a fine of
five pounds sterling. The notice ends with the expressive
Latin adage, “Cornicum oculos configere noli.”</p>

<p>This is the first privilege which I have found in an
English printed book, the next, six months later, having
been granted by the King for Cuthbert Tonstall’s
<i>Oratio in laudem matrimonii Mariæ et Francisci</i>. This
privilege prevented anyone either reprinting it in
England or selling foreign printed copies for the space
of two years. This may seem a short time, but the
subject was only of passing interest. The rise, growth,
and scope of these privileges, which are the foundations
of copyright, form a subject which has hitherto received
little or no attention even from writers on copyright,
though I think it would go far to prove that the perpetual
copyright, which later on was claimed by the stationers,
was never legally recognised, but that the power granted
them by the charter enabled them to impose and uphold
arbitrary restrictions which were not legally
binding.</p>

<p>On the title-page of this and the preceding work
is John Scolar’s device, the shield of the University<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
surmounted by a cap and supported by two angels.
On the shield are the arms, the book with seven seals
between the three crowns, but the motto on the book
in place of the present “Dominus illuminatio mea”
is “Veritas liberabit, bonitas regnavit.” Another
woodcut containing the Royal arms and supporters
is used in these books, which had been used previously
by W. de Worde.</p>

<p>In June 1518 three books were printed: <i>Questiones de
luce et lumine</i>, a tract of eight leaves, Burley’s <i>Principia</i>,
also of eight leaves, and a Grammar of Whitinton.
A new Oxford book from Scolar’s press was discovered
recently in a volume of tracts in the British Museum.
It is an edition of the <i>Opus insolubilium</i>, a text-book for
the schools. It consisted originally of four leaves, but
the last is unfortunately missing. On the first leaf is
the woodcut of the University arms in fresh condition.
This tract may perhaps be the first production of
Scolar’s press.</p>

<p>The <i>Questiones de luce et lumine</i> has on the title-page
a small rough woodcut depicting the visit of the
Magi, belonging to a series made to illustrate a <i>Book of
Hours</i>; and on the title of Burley’s <i>Principia</i> is a small
neat woodcut, rather Italian in style, of a master seated
before a desk with a pupil standing before him. At
the end is a woodcut of the arms of England supported
by the greyhound and dragon. Below are two portcullises,
and above two angels hold ribbons bearing
the motto</p>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Hec rosa virtutis de celo missa sereno</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Eternum florens regia sceptra feret.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>


<p>This woodcut was part of the material obtained by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
Oxford printer from W. de Worde, and which after
the cessation of the press was returned to him. We
find him using it in some of his later books, by which
time it had become slightly damaged by wormholes.</p>

<p>We hear no more of Scolar in Oxford after 1518,
when he probably left the city; but his place was taken
by Charles Kyrfoth, who issued in February 1519 a
<i>Compotus manualis ad usum Oxoniensium</i>, a little
treatise of arithmetic illustrated by wood engravings
of the open hand with values attached to each part.
It is a small tract of eight leaves, and we learn from
Dorne’s accounts that its price was one penny. In
the colophon Kyrfoth gives his address, as did Scolar,
as St John’s Street, and as he used the same device of
the University Arms, we may conclude he had taken
on Scolar’s business. On the title-page is a large and
curious woodcut divided horizontally into three portions.
In the upper is a row of seven books. In the centre
a master in an embroidered robe and crowned with
laurel is seated at a desk, while on either side of him
are scholars taking notes. In the lower part are five
men in gowns holding books. In the text are four
diagrams of hands. The only copy known of this book
is in the University Library. Beyond the occurrence
of his name in this colophon we know nothing further
of Kyrfoth. He probably left Oxford soon after the
issue of this book, for his name is not found in the list
of inhabitants in the Subsidy Rolls of 1524.</p>

<p>Scolar, as we said above, left Oxford in 1518, but
we meet with him again ten years later; for in 1528
he printed a <i>Breviary</i> for the use of the Benedictine
Monastery at Abingdon, which will be noticed hereafter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span></p>

<p>Between 1527 and 1557 nothing was printed at or
for Oxford. The books printed for John Dorne, described
in an earlier lecture, were the last enterprise of
an Oxford publisher. Nor apparently was there any
wish to continue printing, for while Cambridge was
careful during the changes brought about by various
acts to preserve her liberties, and when the act of 1534
against foreign stationers was passed to obtain a special
exemption enabling the University to employ foreign
stationers or printers, Oxford was content to let matters
take their course. The roll of stationers continued
unbroken, and here and there an interesting man, such
as Garbrand Harkes, stands out, but there is little of
interest to chronicle before the revival of the press at
the end of the sixteenth century.</p>

<p>While Oxford was credited by many early bibliographers
with a book printed in 1468, which was not
really printed until 1478, so many of the same authorities
credited Cambridge with a book printed in 1478 which
was not printed at Cambridge at all. The mistakes
and confusions about this book, only finally cleared
up by Bradshaw in 1861, form a curious comedy of
errors.</p>

<p>Among the documents used by Strype when writing
his life of Archbishop Parker was a catalogue of the
books bequeathed to Corpus Christi College by the archbishop,
in which was an entry: “Rhetorica nova, impressa
Cantab, fo. 1478.” This entry was communicated
by Strype to Bagford, then collecting materials for a
history of printing, and Bagford in his turn wrote about
it to Tanner. Tanner’s brother passed on the information
to Ames, who inserted it at the head of his account<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
of Cambridge printing, and from him it was copied
by other writers, including Herbert.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile Conyers Middleton in his <i>Dissertation
concerning the origin of Printing in England</i>,
had turned the error into a new groove. Describing
the edition printed at St Alban’s in octavo in 1480,
he remarks: “The same book is mentioned by Mr Strype
among those given by Archbishop Parker to Corpus
Christi College in Cambridge; but the words, ‘Compilata
in Universitate Cantabrigiæ,’ have drawn this
learned antiquary into the mistake of imagining that
it was printed also in that year at our University, and
of doing us the honour of remarking upon it; so
ancient was printing in Cambridge!”</p>

<p>If the University Librarian, as Middleton then was,
in place of being facetious, had stepped down the street
and examined the book for himself, much subsequent
confusion would have been avoided. He must have
had a poor opinion of Strype if he supposed that that
learned antiquary would describe as a folio printed at
Cambridge in 1478 an octavo with a printed colophon,
“impressa apud Villam Sancti Albani. 1480.”</p>

<p>But Middleton’s plausible suggestion seems to have
gained ground, and the Corpus volume was passed over
as a copy of the St Alban’s book until 1861, when
Bradshaw, at work on the manuscripts in the library
accidentally met with it, and saw at once that it was
not the St Alban’s book, but an unknown Caxton edition.
It has no colophon, so that the concluding words
“Compilata in Universitate Cantabrigiæ,” and the date
1478, might well deceive a casual observer into thinking
it was printed at Cambridge in that year.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span></p>

<p>Printing was introduced into Cambridge at the
beginning of the year 1521 by John Lair of Siberch or
Siegburg, a town a few miles south-west of Cologne.
Like most of the foreign printers settled in England,
he made but little use of his proper surname, but used
the place name instead and called himself John Siberch.</p>

<p>Nothing is known as to the date of his settling in
Cambridge, but it was probably in 1519 or early in
1520, for in May of the latter year an edition of Richard
Croke’s <i>Introductiones in rudimenta Græca</i> was printed
for him by Eucharius Cervicornus at Cologne.</p>

<p>Croke was at this time Professor of Greek at Cambridge,
but he was compelled to have his work printed
abroad, since no English printer of the time possessed
a fount of Greek type. Had he acted on his own initiative,
he would probably have employed a printer of
Paris where he had studied, or Leipzig where he had
recently been a professor, both of which towns had
excellent Greek presses. But if Siberch, a man presumably
with practical knowledge, was already settled
in Cambridge, what could be more natural than for the
professor to hand over the arrangements of the printing
to him, while he in his turn would no doubt entrust
the work to a printer of the town from which he himself
came, and not improbably to the master with whom
he had himself worked. This, of course, is conjecture,
but some curious evidence of Siberch’s having been in
Cambridge when Croke’s book was published, came to
light accidentally in 1889. In that year a volume was
found in the library of Westminster Abbey printed at
Paris in 1519, which had evidently been bound in
Siberch’s workshop. In the binding were several<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
manuscript and printed fragments. The printed fragments
consisted of leaves of the Papyrius Geminus
printed by Siberch in 1522 and two leaves of a hitherto
unknown edition of Lily’s Grammar; amongst the
manuscript fragments was a letter to Siberch, to be
referred to later, and a piece of the manuscript of Croke’s
<i>Rudimenta Græca</i>, bearing upon it the rough pencil
mark indicating the commencement of a new sheet
and a fresh page, both agreeing with the printed book.
The copy then had been returned from abroad, not to
the author Croke, but to the man who had commissioned
the book, Siberch. Had Siberch been abroad when the
book was printed, he would either have corrected the
proofs with the copy at Cologne, and in that case would
hardly have troubled to bring over the then useless
copy with him to England, or else proofs with the copy
would have been sent to Croke, in which case we should
not have expected to find it as waste in Siberch’s shop.</p>

<p>What Siberch’s exact position was in relation to the
University is not quite clear. Dr Caius speaks of him
as the University printer, but no direct evidence of
this has been forthcoming. Mr Gray has, however,
pointed out to me an entry in one of the Grace books
recently printed, and which he was unaware of when
writing his life of Siberch for the Bibliographical Society.
This was one of the graces passed in congregation during
the year from the feast of St Michael the Archangel
[September 29], 1520 to the corresponding date of the
following year. It runs: “Obligatur doctor Manfeld
loco et vice magistri Norres pro summa pecunie quam
recepit Johannes bibliopola ab universitate.” This
debt is entered regularly in the proctors’ accounts,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
printed in another recently-printed Grace book, from
1520-21 up to 1524-25, and the sum mentioned is
twenty pounds.</p>

<p>We have therefore the clearest evidence that some
time between September 1520 and September 1521 the
University had advanced to Siberch the sum of twenty
pounds, and I think we are quite justified in concluding
that this was to assist him in his business as a printer.
The sum of twenty pounds is considerably more than
a University stationer’s fee, and must have been granted
for a special purpose. If the exact date of the grace
in the year could be ascertained, it would probably
throw some light on the question. If early enough, it
might be the cost of material to enable him to set up
his press.</p>

<p>It is not until October 1521 that he uses the words,
“Cum gratia et privilegio.” Bradshaw, in a bibliographical
note on the book in which they first appear,
writes: “In his dedication to Bishop Fisher he [that is,
Siberch] styles himself ‘Io. Siberch Cantabrigiensis
typographus,’ and it must have been on this occasion
and through Bishop Fisher’s influence that he obtained
leave to place ‘Cum gratia et privilegio’ on his title-pages.”
This privilege was not I think the King’s
privilege, such as London printers had just begun to
obtain, but more probably one granted by the Chancellor
similar to that given to Scolar the Oxford printer by
the Oxford Chancellor, and this would further point
to Siberch’s official connexion with the University.</p>

<p>The house where he lived and printed was described
by Dr Caius as situated between the Gate of Humility
and the Gate of Virtue, forming part of some property<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
bought by Caius in 1563 from Trinity College. It
bore the sign of the King’s arms, which accounts for
the use by Siberch in his books of two woodcuts containing
the Royal arms. In the same house Erasmus
lived when he was lecturing at Cambridge, and we know
from his letters that he was on intimate terms with
Siberch and the contemporary Cambridge stationers to
whom he sends greetings by name at the conclusion of
one of his letters.</p>

<p>Having obtained some type Siberch started to work
for himself, and his first production was a speech of
Dr Henry Bullock delivered before Wolsey when the
Cardinal visited the University in the autumn of 1520.
This is a small pamphlet of eight leaves, devoid of all
ornament, and it was published between February 13,
the date of the dedication and the end of the month, in
1521. The type used appears to be new, but where it
was obtained is not settled. It bears a very strong
resemblance to some of Pynson’s, but is not quite
identical. At present we do not know much about
the early business of type-cutting, but it seems clear
that, soon after the commencement of the sixteenth
century, different printers went to a common source
for their type, and that type-cutting was not a part of
the printer’s business, as it was when printing was first
invented, but a special trade. New types would thus
tend to conform more to a common model. Of this
first Cambridge book four copies are known, but unfortunately
there is no copy in Cambridge, the four
copies being in the British Museum, the Bodleian, the
Lambeth Library, and Archbishop Marsh’s Library,
Dublin. The Bodleian copy had belonged to Richard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
Burton, the author of the <i>Anatomy of Melancholy</i>,
the Lambeth one to Archbishop Bancroft, so that at
any rate for a few years, between 1646 and 1662, this
latter copy was with the rest of the Archbishop’s books
upon the shelves of the University Library.</p>

<p>About April, in 1521, according to Bradshaw’s calculation,
Siberch’s second book appeared, the sermon of
Augustine, <i>De miseria ac brevitate vitæ</i>, a book of twelve
leaves. The printer had added a little to his stock of
type, for there is a Greek motto on the title-page which
is also enclosed between two border-pieces.</p>

<p>This type is interesting as the first genuine moveable
Greek type used in England. A year or two
earlier W. de Worde had introduced a few words of
Greek into an edition of one of Whitinton’s Grammars,
but the words were roughly cut on wood. Pynson did
not begin to use Greek until 1524 in a work by Linacre,
and in the preface he offers a curious apology for its
imperfections, praying the reader to pardon missing
breathings or accents, since he had but recently cast
the Greek types and had not prepared a supply sufficient
to finish the work completely.</p>

<p>The amount of Greek printing in all Siberch’s books
put together is very small, hardly enough to call for
the cutting of a special fount, for it must be borne in
mind that a Greek fount is infinitely larger and more
complex than a Roman. One specially complicated
fount used at Venice in 1486 contained about 1350
sorts. It seems probable therefore that we must look
to some foreign source for this type, and its identification
might throw some further light on Siberch’s business
career.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span></p>

<p>The two border side-pieces, each containing three
small scenes in canopied compartments relating to the
Last Judgment, evidently form part of a set for use in
a <i>Book of Hours</i>. These identical border-pieces have
not been found used elsewhere, but are evidently
copied from, and resemble in every detail, two of a set
used in a <i>Book of Hours</i> printed at Kirchheim. Very
little, however, can be deduced from similarity of
design, for printers copied designs which pleased them
from any source, and often with such extraordinary
accuracy as to require very careful scrutiny to distinguish
the copy from the original.</p>

<p>This is the rarest of all Siberch’s books, for only
one copy is known, now in the Bodleian. It formerly
belonged to John Selden and went with the rest of his
books to Oxford by bequest in 1659.</p>

<p>Of the next book four copies are known. It consists
of a translation of Lucian’s πὲρι διψάδων by Henry
Bullock, and a reissue of the latter’s Oration. On the
title-page Siberch uses for the first time his ornamental
border with the Royal arms at the base. A very
curious statement, that this border is the first specimen
of English copperplate engraving, has found its way
into a number of books. Its earliest appearance seems
to be in Herbert’s <i>Typographical Antiquities</i>, where a
so-called facsimile is given. Now this facsimile itself
is a very roughly-executed metal engraving, and from
the text it is clear that Herbert made his description
from this rough engraving and not from the book
itself. The proof of this is clear. The engraver has
added a rough facsimile of the two-lined colophon,
immediately below the border, and Herbert, assuming<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
it to be part of the title-page, has so described it in his
text. The most cursory glance would show this border
to be a woodcut, but the old statement goes on being
repeated.</p>

<p>The fourth book, Baldwin’s <i>Sermo de altaris sacramento</i>
was issued in the summer, probably August, of
1521. In this is found for the first time the smaller
device of the Royal arms. Eight copies of the book
are known, two being in the University Library while
another has lately been discovered in the library of
Magdalene College. One of those in the University
Library, which it is suggested may be an early copy
sent to Nicholas West, bishop of Ely, to whom the
book is dedicated, shows some variations from the
ordinary copies. It is clear that it is an early issue,
since the border is without a small break noticeable in
other copies, and the first word of the title-page, Reverendissimi,
has been misprinted Reverndissimi, a mistake
almost immediately noticed and corrected. In this
book, for the first time, Siberch begins to use one of
his ornamental capitals, a fine six-line S.</p>

<p>Siberch’s fifth book, <i>Erasmus De conscribendis epistolis</i>,
was issued in October 1521. This is a more important
book in point of size than any which preceded it, containing
eighty leaves, whereas the largest of the others
only ran to twenty. It also shows certain marks of
advance. We find for the first time a frequent use of
fine initial letters, and it is the first book for which
the printer obtained a privilege, unfortunately not
printed in full. Four copies of this book are known,
two in the British Museum, and two in Cambridge
College Libraries, St John’s and Corpus. The last<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
copy has the additional interest of being bound by a
contemporary Cambridge stationer, Nicholas Speryng,
and bears his mark and initials on the binding.</p>

<p>The Erasmus was followed by Galen <i>De Temperamentis</i>,
translated from the Greek by Linacre. This is
the commonest of Siberch’s books, at least twelve
copies being known, but some of these show important
variations. The first intention seems to have been to
issue the <i>De Temperamentis</i> alone, and it was so printed
off on sixty-six leaves, with the signatures A⁴, Q⁶.
Later it was determined to add another small treatise
<i>De inequali intemperie</i>, so the last two leaves of the
first issue, containing the end of the <i>De Temperamentis</i>
were cancelled, and two new sheets R⁴ and S⁶ added.
Finally a preliminary quire of eight leaves was printed,
making the complete book consist of seventy-four leaves.
One copy of the first state is known, first noticed by Mr
Bowes in the library of Trinity College, Dublin, in 1894.
On the verso of the penultimate leaf is a woodcut of
the Adoration of the Shepherds and the colophon, on
the verso of the last leaf the small block of the Royal
arms and the date 1521. A transitional copy, containing
the first issue with the end uncancelled, but the
additional sheets added, is in the library of the Royal
College of Physicians. All the remaining copies are
of the revised issue. In it the last two leaves are
mainly occupied with a list of the errata which had been
found in the <i>De Temperamentis</i>, and on the verso of
the last leaf is the device of the Royal arms. The
woodcut of the Shepherds found in the early copies
has not as yet been traced to an earlier source. It
is apparently Low Country work of the fifteenth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
century; Sir Martin Conway ascribes it to about the
year 1485.</p>

<p>Two copies of the Galen were printed on vellum,
both of which are now in Oxford, one in the library of
All Souls College, the other in the Bodleian. This
latter copy possesses a curious pedigree. It was presented
to the Bodleian in 1634 by Thomas Clayton,
Regius Professor of Medicine. In a long Latin note
which he has written in the volume he states that it
was given by Linacre to Henry VIII. who in his turn
gave it to Cuthbert Tonstall, and after passing through
various hands it had come into his possession, and he
finally has deposited it in the Bodleian. It is an interesting
copy, but whether it ever belonged to Henry is
very doubtful. It is in the original binding, but this
is simply an ordinary stationer’s binding impressed
in blind with the two panels of the Royal arms and
Tudor rose used by many of the London binders of the
time. Again one sheet has been incorrectly printed.
In printing the reverse side of a sheet in signature S,
the workman has laid the sheet the wrong way round
on the form and consequently the pages follow one
another in the wrong order, a fruitful and common
cause of waste sheets. Finally the ornamental initials
in the early part of the book have not been printed in,
and no attempt has been made to supply them by hand.
It does not seem probable that so poor a copy would
have been presented to the King. An early inscription
shows that it belonged to Tonstall, who gave it to
Richard Sparchford, archdeacon of Shropshire, who
gave it to the church of Ludlow.</p>

<p>The seventh book is a translation into Latin by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
Richard Pace of the sermon preached by John Fisher,
bishop of Rochester, in London, to an audience said
to have numbered thirty thousand, on the occasion of
the public burning of Luther’s works. In this book
for the first time Siberch made use of the device with
his initials and mark within a chain work frame showing
white on a black background, an uncommon style of
device and one unlike any other used in England at
the time. Of this book only four copies are known,
two in the Bodleian, one in the library of Magdalene
College, Cambridge, and one in the Rylands Library,
Manchester.</p>

<p>The last dated of the early Cambridge books is the
<i>Hermathena</i> of Papyrius Geminus, issued on December
8, 1522. No less than three different states of the
title-page are known. The first is quite free from
ornament, in the second an attempt seems to have
been made to supply the want of the old border device,
and the upper part of the title is enclosed in a frame
made by two horizontal border-pieces joined at the
sides by a plain fine. In the third state, a third border-piece
has been added at the bottom of the page and the
black lines extended on either side to join all three. The
book contains twenty-six leaves, the last leaf containing
on the recto the colophon and printer’s device, on the
verso the small <i>arma regia</i> device. Six copies are
known. With the title in the first state one copy
remains, which formerly belonged to Bradshaw and
is now in the University Library. Of the second state
there are three copies, in Archbishop Marsh’s Library,
in Lincoln Cathedral, and in St John’s College, Cambridge.
Of the third state the two copies belong to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>the British Museum and the Duke of Devonshire.
These last two copies are both printed on vellum, but
the museum copy wants the last leaf containing the
colophon and devices.</p>

<p>The publication of another Cambridge book, an
edition of the Grammar of Lily and Erasmus, was
proved by the discovery in 1889 of two leaves, found
with some other most interesting fragments in the covers
of a book in Westminster Abbey Library.</p>

<p>The Grammar is the <i>De octo orationis partium constructione
libellus</i> written for the use of St Paul’s School.
It was composed originally by William Lily, and Colet,
the founder of the school, sent the work to Erasmus to
emend. Erasmus so altered it that Lily would not
permit it to be called his work, and as Erasmus for his
part refused to put his name to Lily’s work, the book
was published anonymously. It became very popular,
and many editions were issued abroad for the English
market, so that it is just such a book as a Cambridge
printer might be expected to print rather than to
import.</p>

<p>These nine books comprise the whole output of the
early Cambridge press. Though Cambridge obtained
a special privilege shortly afterwards giving the right
to print, the right was never exercised, and nothing
was produced in the town until the two Universities
restarted their presses towards the end of the sixteenth
century.</p>

<p>The bookbindings that can definitely be assigned
to Siberch are at present few in number. He used one
fine roll divided into four rectangular compartments,
containing a pomegranate, a turretted gateway with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
portcullis, a Tudor rose, and three fleurs-de-lys, all
surmounted by a royal crown and within canopied
archways. Below the fleurs-de-lys are his initials.
This is a purely English design, and the tool was no
doubt made for him after his arrival in Cambridge.
Immediately Siberch gave up work, about 1523-24,
the tool passed to Speryng, who mutilated it, so that we
know fairly well the period during which it was used
when undamaged. Its use in conjunction with other
tools enables more of Siberch’s material to be identified.
In the University Library is a copy of the <i>Epistolæ</i>
of Paulinus, bishop of Nola, printed at Paris in 1516,
whose binding is impressed with two well-executed
panel stamps separated from each other by this roll.
On one is depicted St Roche tended by an angel for the
plague and a dog bringing him food, on the other St
John Baptist, standing on a mound and preaching to
four persons seated below him. These two saints were
popular subjects for binding panels, and a number
of varieties, mostly copied one from another, are known,
but this particular pair are especially well designed and
engraved, and were chosen by Dibdin to reproduce
in his <i>Bibliographical Decameron</i>.</p>

<p>On a folio in the library of Clare College, Siberch’s
signed roll is found used with another roll or band
containing figures of seven peasants, one piping, the
rest dancing with hands joined, a very favourite design
with Netherlandish binders.</p>

<p>The two panel stamps and this second roll are all
foreign in appearance, and were no doubt brought by
Siberch from abroad. After he gave up work they
remained in England. I have a work of Erasmus,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
printed in 1532, certainly bound in this country, which
has the two panels on the binding, while the roll with
dancing figures occurs on a binding in St Paul’s Cathedral
Library, lined with waste leaves of an Almanac for 1544.
It is not improbable that Siberch had other panels, for
we find, soon after he ceased to bind, stamps which were
certainly his used in conjunction with others exactly
similar in style. I saw lately a work of Erasmus, dated
1524, on which this St Roche panel was used, and with
it was a panel with St Michael, and these two occur
together elsewhere. One point, however, must certainly
be noticed. The one panel binding that we can
with certainty attribute to Siberch has three bands on
the back, as was usual in the case of English bindings.
Every other binding with his stamps which I have
seen has four bands, and a binder would be most unlikely
to change his habits on such a point.</p>

<p>The letter of Peter Kaetz to Siberch, referred to
earlier, is of the greatest interest. It is written on one
side of an oblong piece of paper, with the address on the
other side. Unfortunately parts of the ends of some
of the lines are missing, making parts of certain sentences
vague, especially at the beginning, but generally the
meaning is fairly clear. It has been translated by
Mr Hessels as follows: “Know, Jan Siborch, that I
have received your letter as [well as specimens] of your
type, and it is very good; if you can otherwise ... and
conduct yourself well then you will get enough
to print. So I remain still in London because my
master comes; I expect him from day to day, therefore
I cannot even know when I cross, but so soon as I cross
I shall do the best that is in my power. Item, I have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
told Peter Rinck three or four times of the Pater noster,
but he tells me that he cannot find it; and Gibkerken
has not yet given Jacob Pastor the ring, but he carries
it every day on his hand and he will not give it to Jacob
Pastor. Item, I send you 25 prognostications and
3 New Testaments small. The prognostications cost
one shilling sterling the 25, and the 3 New Testaments
cost 2 shillings and 6 pence sterling, so there is still
due to you, which I remain in your debt. I have no
more New Testaments, otherwise I should have sent
you more. I have nothing else to write except [to ask
you to] deliver the accompanying parcel to Niclas, and
greet Baetzken for me with your whole family, and do
not forget yourself. Petrus Kaetz.”</p>

<p>Among the fragments found with it was part of the
manuscript copy of Croke’s book printed in May 1520,
a sheet of the Papyrius Geminus printed in 1522, and
two leaves of the Lily’s <i>Grammar</i>. The book in which
they were found must have been bound after December
1522, but the tools on the binding are not those known
to have been used by Siberch, and the book may have
been bound after Siberch ceased work by someone
occupying his old workshop or who had obtained his
waste material. From internal evidence the letter
would appear to have been written in 1521 just after
Siberch had started printing, the reference to the
excellence of the type, of which proofs had apparently
been sent, and the remark by Kaetz that if Siberch
conducted himself well he would get enough to print,
both pointing to this conclusion. One small point may
be noticed here in passing. The tone of the letter is
that of an older to a younger man, or at any rate, of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
man to one of his own age. Now in the colophons of
books printed for Kaetz between 1523 and 1525 he is
spoken of as “juvenis” and this may be taken as a
slight argument for believing that in 1521 Siberch was
a young man also.</p>

<p>The master to whom Kaetz referred was very possibly
Christopher Endoviensis or Van Ruremond, who, when
Kaetz set up in business on his own account, printed
books for him. Van Ruremond we know printed
English prognostications, single folio broadsides such
as would be sold at a penny a piece, which as we know
from Dorne’s day-book was the usual price of a single
sheet, so that he may have been the printer of these
supplied to Siberch at twenty-five for a shilling. The
New Testaments were probably of a Latin version
since they are called Nova Testamenta in the letter.
Nicholas, to whom a packet was sent, was, we may
suppose, Speryng.</p>

<p>After 1522 Siberch seems to have relinquished his
business as a printer and stationer. We have no
reference to him in accounts, and as his name does not
occur in the Subsidy Rolls of 1523-24 it may be considered
as fairly certain that he was not then in Cambridge.
That he had definitely given up work is clearly
shown by the dispersal of his material. The smaller
neatly-executed cut of the Royal arms went to his
friend Peter Kaetz, who, taking it with him on his return
to Antwerp, used it in the edition of the Dutch Bible
printed for him there in 1525 by Hans Van Ruremonde.
Apparently the same block appears in an edition of
Erasmus and Lily’s Grammar published at Antwerp by
Godfried van der Haeghen in 1527 for sale in St Paul’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
Churchyard. The fine border of the Galen also went
to Antwerp and is found eventually on the title-page
of a Dutch Prognostication of 1536 printed by Hendrick
Pietersen van Middleburch. From a comparison of a
recently-issued facsimile of the Dutch book with the
original Cambridge book, it is clear the border is identical
in both. What has now to be done is to trace it between
1522 and 1536. Lastly, the fine binding roll which
he possessed passed into the hands of Nicholas Speryng
who attempted to obliterate the initial I upon it and
substitute an N. The latest binding on which it is
found in an unmutilated state is on a book printed at
Venice and finished on November 10, 1522, so that the
binding cannot be earlier than 1523. The mutilated
tool is found used with others belonging to Speryng
on the binding of a book printed in 1524.</p>

<p>For a considerable time after 1522 we have no
information. The debt of twenty pounds continued
to be entered in the proctor’s accounts up to the year
1524-25, after which it dropped out. In 1538-39 the
debt is re-entered in a most interesting memorandum
which may be translated thus: “Note; that twenty
pounds sterling are owing to the university by
‘Dominus’ John Lair, an alien priest, and Doctors
Rydley, Bullock, Wakefelde, and Maundefelde, and it
has their bond signed by all their hands, and sealed
with their seals.” After several entries of a similar
tenor we come to the final one in the Audit book under
the year 1553. “John Syberche owes out of the money
advanced to him [xx. li.], as is evidenced by his bond
contained in the common chest, and his guarantors
are Doctors Rydley, Bullocke, and Manfyld, together<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
with Mr Wakfyld.” It would thus appear that like
many another, Siberch was so influenced by the religious
movements of the time, that he forsook his
business in order to serve the Church, and it is therefore
in this sphere that we should seek for further information
about him. He seems also to have made use of
his proper name Lair, sometimes corrupted into Law,
rather than the name Siberch he had used as a printer.</p>

<p>Perhaps further search in this new direction may
result in fresh discoveries.</p>

<p>The stationers of Cambridge, like the stationers of
Oxford, were of two classes, those officially appointed
by the University and those who traded independently.
In the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries there are
frequent references to the rights of the University over
the stationers. They had certain official duties, such as
the valuation of books and the supply of the necessary
school books at fixed rates, and the stationers chosen
by the University received a small fee or salary for such
work. After the middle of the fifteenth century the
stationers can be traced in an unbroken series, but
though we know their names and find entries of their
business in accounts, there, at present, our information
ceases. Five names are given in Mr Gray’s account
of the early Cambridge stationers for the second half
of the fifteenth century, Gerard Wake, John Ward,
Fydyon, perhaps Fitzjohn, William Squire, and Walter
Hatley. Of these, two, Wake and Hatley, were bookbinders,
and perhaps some of their work may yet be
identified, and if one single volume could be ascribed
to either with certainty and the stamps they used
definitely ascertained, then much of their work could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
be traced. William Squire is only known from receiving
a settled fee of thirteen shillings and fourpence between
the years 1482-6. He may perhaps, since we find the
names Squire and Lesquier often used indiscriminately,
be identical with the stationer William Lesquier whose
goods were administered at Oxford in February 1501-2.
Peter Breynans, another bookbinder, is mentioned in
1502, and a Lawrence Topfeller in 1506.</p>

<p>In May 1503 the award of Margaret, Countess of
Richmond, and three other arbitrators was agreed to
and signed. This covenant between the town and
University contained special references to stationers,
and enacted that only those stationers and binders
who had always practised their trade should be
considered under the jurisdiction of the University,
a certain number, then in business, being
exempted.</p>

<p>Our knowledge of early Cambridge bookbinding is
curiously different from what we know of Oxford.
There our knowledge of fifteenth-century work is full,
and of early sixteenth almost a blank. For Cambridge
there is a splendid series of early sixteenth-century
work, while fifteenth-century specimens are almost
unknown or at any rate unidentified. Mr G. J. Gray’s
excellent monograph, lately published by the Bibliographical
Society, has fully put on record what is known
about Cambridge binding, and has the advantage of
being well illustrated. The earliest examples facsimiled
in his work are ornamented by means of the roll-tool,
but there is a series of bindings ornamented with dies
in the earlier manner produced probably about 1500,
which may with considerable probability be ascribed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
to a Cambridge binder. These bindings are very
distinctive in appearance and may easily be distinguished
from others of the same period. One peculiarity enables
us to identify this binder’s work even when on
the shelves. He always ruled two perpendicular lines
down the back. The leather used is nearly always
the red-tinted variety which seems peculiar to Cambridge.
The scheme of decoration of the sides consisted
of a large centre panel divided by diagonal lines into
a kind of diamond-shaped lattice work, and in each
division thus formed a die was stamped. These dies,
mostly square or diamond-shaped, contained conventional
flowers or strange animals and birds. The best
two, which are very finely engraved, have two cocks
fighting and a pelican feeding her young. This binder
also made frequent use of a small tool of a spray of
foliage, plain and not enclosed in a frame, and this
he used to build up borders and to finish the ends of
the bands, a noticeable peculiarity. The boards were
usually lined with vellum.</p>

<p>When Dr James prepared his catalogue of manuscripts
in the library of Pembroke College, the librarian,
Mr Minns, added an appendix containing an account
of the early printed books and a plate of facsimiles of
stamps used on some of the bindings. Those numbered
21 to 32 belonged to this binder and occur on four
bindings. Three of these are on printed books ranging
between 1478 and 1490. The fourth specimen is more
important as affording a definite clue to a Cambridge
origin, for it is on the second volume of the college
register. A search for and examination of such bindings
as remain in Cambridge might result in the discovery<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
of some inscription or other evidence which
might enable us to identify the binder.</p>

<p>The earliest of the important sixteenth-century
binders and stationers is Garret Godfrey, and his name
is first found affixed to a deed in 1503 which itself
relates to the position of stationers and bookbinders
in the University. He was a native of the Low Countries,
and from the occurrence of the name Graten on some
waste sheets extracted from some of his bindings, is
supposed to have come from Graten in Limburg. He
seems to have occupied a good position in Cambridge,
and was chosen as one of the churchwardens of St
Mary the Great in 1516, and continued to fill offices in
connexion with the church for several years. He died
in 1539 and was buried in St Mary’s, while his will,
dated September 12, was proved on October 11.</p>

<p>Godfrey was well supplied with binding tools, and
we find him in possession of at least five rolls. The
most important contains figures of a griffin, a wyvern,
and a lion, separated from each other by branches of
foliage. Below the lion are the binder’s initials, the
second having a sign like an arrow-head springing from
the top, representing presumably his merchant’s mark.
The workmanship of this roll very much resembles
that of some of the fine London rolls of the time, those
for example of John Reynes or Thomas Symonds, and
it is quite probable that they may all have been engraved
by the same man.</p>

<p>Godfrey’s second roll is divided into five divisions.
The first four contain a turretted gateway with portcullis,
a fleur-de-lys, a pomegranate, and a Tudor rose,
each under a canopy and surmounted by a Royal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
crown. The fifth contains the binder’s initials G. G.
and between them a shield charged with three horse-shoes.
This introduction of a private heraldic shield
into a bookbinder’s ornament, is, so far as my experience
goes, quite without parallel and certainly requires
explanation. Occurring as it does, between the binder’s
initials, it must obviously have some connexion with
him, and the initials are certainly those of Garret
Godfrey. The late Sir Augustus Franks suggested
that the initials stood for Guido Gimpus. The name
is not mentioned by Burke in his <i>Armorial</i>, but Papworth
allows a coat “sable, three horse-shoes argent,”
to a family, Vytan-Gimpus, on the authority of Glover’s
<i>Ordinary</i>. A third roll containing the Royal emblem
in compartments, in the same order as in the previous
one, also contains his initials, but with no arms. This
is a much narrower roll than the second, and poorer
in design. The fourth and fifth rolls have no mark
or initials, one is of diaper work, the other of interlaced
strap work. In addition Godfrey used a few small dies.</p>

<p>Nicholas Speryng, the second stationer, came originally
from the Low Countries, and is found settled in
Cambridge, perhaps as early as 1506, certainly by 1513.
It seems likely that he had worked as a binder before
coming to Cambridge, and that he brought some of
his binding tools with him. An examination of his
bindings shows that he often worked in a more old-fashioned
style and with older tools than Godfrey.
The ornamental frames on the sides of his bindings
are in many cases built up by a repetition of single
stamps, a troublesome system superseded by the invention
of the roll. As he possessed the stamps he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
would naturally use them, but he would not have had
them engraved had the use of the roll been then known
to him. The two panel stamps which he used are also
probably of foreign make. These contain representations
of the Annunciation on the one side, and St
Nicholas restoring the three murdered children on the
other. The Annunciation was a very favourite subject
with bookbinders, especially those of the Low Countries,
while the St Nicholas had reference to the binder’s
Christian name. It is curious to notice that the surname
has been wrongly engraved, and reads Spiernick
in place of Spierinck. Some years ago some fragments
of an edition of Holt’s Grammar, the <i>Lac Puerorum</i>,
printed in English at Antwerp by Adrian van Berghen,
were found in the Bodleian, which, from the indentations
still remaining on them, had clearly formed the
boards of one of these bindings, and on one of the
fragments the name Speyrinck was written. The piece
of paper had doubtless formed the wrapper of a parcel
addressed to him.</p>

<p>Speryng’s rolls were all engraved after he came to
England. The finest, apparently engraved by the
same hand as Godfrey’s, contains figures of a dragon,
a lion, and a wyvern amidst sprays of foliage. Between
the wyvern and dragon, in a wreath, are his mark and
initials. A smaller roll is divided into five compartments,
the first four containing a fleur-de-lys, a turretted
gateway, a pomegranate, and a Tudor rose, each surmounted
by a Royal crown and under a canopy, while
the fifth contains his mark and initials. It is an almost
exact copy of one of Godfrey’s rolls, with the badges
arranged in a different order. There are two varieties<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
of this roll. In the earlier the binder’s initial S is a
rather badly engraved letter of a curious script form,
but at a later date it has been re-engraved in the more
usual form. Weale, describing the earlier state in one
place, reads the initials N. G., and in another ascribes
the roll to Segar Nicholson, a later Cambridge stationer.</p>

<p>Speryng had also a roll of diaper work resembling,
though clearly differing from, Godfrey’s, and another
roll with a graceful pattern of twining foliage and
flowers. He also, like Godfrey, had several dies.</p>

<p>There is a binding in Westminster Abbey Library
on a copy of a <i>Codex Justiniani</i> printed at Paris in 1515
which both Godfrey and Speryng appear to have had
a hand in with remarkable results. First the volume
was bound by Godfrey, who ornamented the side with
a framework made with his fine broad roll, with two
parallel impressions of the same roll inside the panel.
The volume somehow came later into Speryng’s hands.
He filled up the vacant spaces with his own diaper roll,
and then stamped his ornamental roll with his initials
over Godfrey’s, mixing the ornaments in hopeless confusion.
We find the body of Speryng’s wyvern with
the head of one of Godfrey’s animals, and so on.</p>

<p>One roll used by Speryng had belonged to Siberch,
and I found it many years ago on a binding in Westminster
Abbey Library. Commenting on this binding
Mr Gray writes: “We have evidence of Siberch’s grand
roll being used by Spierinck on the binding of a Faber,
Paris, 1526; the J is obliterated by the N being stamped
over it, but not completely, for Siberch’s initial can be
plainly seen underneath, and this roll was used with
one of Spierinck’s own.” This explanation is hardly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
clear. Speryng did not use Siberch’s roll on the binding
and then attempt to stamp an N over the J. What
he did do was to try and cut on the brass tool itself
an N which should replace the J, but the work was
clumsily done and portions of the J still show.</p>

<p>The binding of the Faber just mentioned is stamped
with Siberch’s mutilated roll and one of Speryng’s
diaper rolls, and this was the only known example of
the use of the mutilated roll. Not long ago, however,
I found in the library of Queen’s College, Oxford, a
copy of the <i>Decretals</i> of Panormitanus printed at Lyons
in 1524 in four large folio volumes in a magnificent
Cambridge binding. On it is used the mutilated roll
of Siberch, Speryng’s largest signed roll, and his smaller
floral roll. Speryng died about the end of 1545 and was
buried in St Mary’s Church. His will, dated August
20, 1545, was proved on January 27 following.</p>

<p>In 1523 an act was passed to prevent the taking of
alien apprentices, and a further act of 1529 prohibited
aliens, not householders, from exercising any handicraft,
but in both acts the two Universities of Oxford and
Cambridge were exempted. In the latter year Wolsey
was petitioned by the University to be allowed to have
three foreign licensed booksellers, and when in 1534
the act was passed restricting the dealings of foreign
stationers, special permission was granted to Cambridge
to elect three stationers or printers who might be aliens
or natives. No similar privilege was either asked for
by or granted to Oxford.</p>

<p>The University immediately appointed the three
stationers, Nicholas Speryng, Garret Godfrey, and Segar
Nicholson, who appear to have been themselves instrumental<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
in procuring the grant. Strangely enough the
date of this grant providing for increased activity
apparently exactly coincides with a remarkable cessation
of work. No book is known bound by Speryng
printed later than 1533, though he did not die until the
end of 1545, while the latest dated book bound by
Godfrey, who died in 1539, is 1535. After this date we
find no more fine bindings. The beautiful broad rolls
and panel stamps went out of fashion and were superseded
by narrow rolls of formal renaissance ornament.
As at Oxford the succession of stationers and binders
continued unbroken; but their work is of little interest.</p>

<p><span class="smcap large">The</span> next place after Cambridge is Tavistock, where
a book was printed in 1525. It was an edition of the
<i>De consolatione philosophiæ</i> of Boethius, translated
into verse and divided into eight-line stanzas. In most
manuscripts of the poem the author is given as Johannes
Capellanus, but at the end of this edition are some
verses whose first and last letters give the names of the
patroness, Elizabeth Berkeley, and the translator,
Johannes Waltwnem or Walton, said to have been a

Mayster Robert Langdon, anno d. MDXXV.” It was
no doubt produced at the expense of Robert Langdon
of Keverell, a rough woodcut of whose arms occurs at
the end of the book. He was a wealthy Cornish gentleman,
who married an heiress and died in 1548.</p>

<p>The book is printed in a neat and clear black-letter.
On the title-page is a woodcut of the Almighty seated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
in a diamond-shaped panel, the outside angles being
filled with symbols of the four evangelists. Copies of
this book are not so rare as is generally supposed. There
are two in the Bodleian, and one in Exeter College,
Oxford. One is in the Rylands Library, another in
St Andrews University, while Lord Bute, Mr Christie
Miller, and the Duke of Bedford all have examples.</p>

<p>The only other Tavistock book known is the <i>Charter
and Statutes of the Stannary</i>, printed nine years later.
The colophon runs: “Here endyth the statutes of the
stannary, Imprented yn Tavystoke ye xx. day of
August, the yere of the reygne off our soveryne Lord
Kynge Henry ye viii. the xxvi. yere.” The book is in
quarto, and contains twenty-six leaves of thirty or thirty-one
lines. On the title-page is a woodcut of the King’s
arms supported by angels, which occurs several times elsewhere
in the book. The colophon is on the penultimate
leaf, and on the recto of the last leaf is a woodcut of the
crucifixion of St Andrew, on the verso the same woodcut
of the Almighty as is used in the Boethius. Of
this book only one copy is known, in the library of
Exeter College, Oxford. It is a most beautifully preserved
example, entirely uncut, and was bequeathed
to the college with a number of other rare books by
the Rev. Joseph Sandford.</p>

<p>The press at Abingdon is represented by one book
only, and of that only one copy is known, preserved
amongst Archbishop Sancroft’s books in the library
of Emmanuel. It is a <i>Breviary</i> printed for the use of
the brethren of St Mary’s Monastery, the black monks
of the order of St Benedict. It is printed in red and
black, in double columns, with thirty-four lines to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
page, and there are no headlines, catchwords, or numbers
to the leaves. When complete it should have contained
358 leaves, but unfortunately two leaves of the Kalendar
containing the months from May to August are missing.
The Kalendar at present consists of four leaves, three
signed AI, AII, AIII, and one unsigned leaf; and the
missing two leaves should have come between AII
and AIII, which looks as though the printer had originally
omitted them by mistake. But so important an
error could not remain uncorrected. A very curious
point about the book is that one part is set up entirely
in quires of sixes, while the rest is set up in a way
common to several early English printers, in quires
alternately of eight and four leaves, thus doing away
with the half sheet. The colophon states that the
book was printed by John Scolar in the monastery
of the blessed virgin at Abingdon, in the year of our
Lord, 1528, and of Thomas Rowland, the abbot, the
seventeenth year. Another colophon gives the more
exact date of September 12. Throughout the book
occur some curious woodcut initials. Two, a large E
and S, are exceedingly bad copies of good work. A
large C contains the figure of a knight in armour, a
very close copy of one used earlier at Cambridge.</p>

<p>The printer, John Scolar, is doubtless the Oxford
printer of 1517-18, but where he had been or what he
had been doing in the intervening ten years we have
not the slightest evidence to show. Since he is not
mentioned among the stationers and booksellers in the
Oxford Lay Subsidy Roll of 1524, we may presume he
was not in the town.</p>

<p>The last of these monastic presses was at St Alban’s.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
The earlier press, spoken of in a previous lecture, was
at work from about 1480 to 1486, but we have no reason
for believing that it was connected with the abbey.
The town is specifically mentioned in the colophons
with no reference to the abbey, nor is any person
connected with the abbey mentioned as favouring or
assisting in the production of the books. As regards
the revived press the case is quite different. The books
were produced at the request of the abbot, Robert
Catton, or his successor, Richard Stevenage, and the
latter’s close connexion with the press is shown by the
occurrence of his initials in the device placed at the
end of some of the books.</p>

<p>The second St Alban’s press was at work from 1534
up to the time of the suppression of the abbey in 1539.
One book, however, may be earlier than this date, a
<i>Breviary</i> of St Alban’s use. The unique copy is in the
library of the Marquis of Bute at Cardiff Castle, but I
have never had an opportunity of examining it, nor
have any facsimiles from it been published, so that it
is impossible to determine when or where it was printed.
The librarian at Cardiff Castle considers it to have been
printed at the abbey about 1526.</p>

<p>In 1534 was issued the <i>Lyfe and passion of Seint
Albon prothomartyr of Englande</i>, translated by John
Lidgate, and printed at the request of Robert Catton,
abbot of St Alban’s. This book, of which two copies
are known, has no printer’s name or place of printing,
but is generally ascribed to Herford’s press. The next
book is Gwynneth’s <i>Confutation of Frith’s Book</i>, dated
1536. Of this there is a copy in the University Library.
It again contains no printer’s name, but has a device<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
having in the centre the initials R. S. joined by a band,
standing for Richard Stevenage, the last abbot of St
Alban’s. In 1537 there is an edition of the <i>Introduction
for to lerne to reken with the pen</i>. A copy was mentioned
by Ames as in the possession of W. Jones, Esq., but
this has since disappeared, though a last leaf containing
the device is said to be amongst the Bagford fragments.
There may be some confusion between this and Bourman’s
edition, whose device was very similar to the
one used by Herford. The description given by Herbert
makes no mention of printer, place, or device, merely
the date 1537.</p>

<p>Three more books are quoted by Herbert under
the year 1538. <i>A godly disputation between Justus and
Peccator</i>, <i>The rule of an honest life</i>, written by Martin,
bishop of Dumience, and <i>An epistle against the enemies
of poor people</i>. Two, if not three, appear to have had
full colophons, stating that they were printed at St
Alban’s by John Herford for Richard Stevenage, but
unfortunately no copies of any of these books are now
known, so that we have no book which contains Herford’s
name which was printed at St Alban’s. These three
books were originally mentioned in Maunsell’s catalogue,
but Herbert’s entries are considerably fuller and must
have been derived from some other source. There is
no reason to doubt their genuineness, and we know
from other evidence that Herford was at St Alban’s.</p>

<p>An undated book, printed at St Alban’s by Herford,
was in Lord Spencer’s collection, and is now at Manchester.
It is entitled, <i>A very declaration of the bond
and free wyll of man: the obedyence of the gospell and
what the very gospell meaneth</i>. This book, hitherto<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
unknown to bibliographers, contains the name of the
place only, and has no date or printer’s name.</p>

<p>In 1539 Herford appears to have been indiscreet
and to have printed some very unorthodox book.
Among the State papers is a letter from Stevenage, the
abbot, to Thomas Cromwell, in which he writes: “Sent
John Pryntare to London with Harry Pepwell, Bonere
[Bonham] and Tabbe of Powlles churchyard stationers,
to order him at your pleasure. Never heard of the
little book of detestable heresies till the stationers
showed it me.” The book spoken of must have been
considered to be of importance, when three of the
leading London stationers were sent down to make
inquiries about it. It may be that this was the
undated book last mentioned, for it alone is without
the name or device of the abbot himself, yet if the
printer had thought that he was publishing anything
obnoxious to the powers, he would hardly have added
“printed at St Alban’s” to his book. The abbot’s
letter was dated October 12, and two months later the
abbey was handed over to Henry VIII.’s commissioners.
Of Herford we hear nothing more for five years.</p>

<p>On the suppression of the abbey the printing
material was moved to London, where it was used for
a short time by a printer, Nicholas Bourman. Now the
name of the last abbot of St Alban’s was Richard
Stevenage or Boreman, and it is quite probable that
this Nicholas was some relative to whom the presses
and type were entrusted during Herford’s absence.
The device used by Bourman was almost identical with
that used at St Alban’s by Herford, the initials of
Richard Stevenage in the latter being replaced by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
N. B., and a book which had been printed in the abbey,
the <i>Introduction to learn to reckon with the pen</i>, was
reprinted by Bourman in 1539. The last definite date
in a St Alban’s book is 1538, and, in the following year,
Herford, the printer, was taken to London and presumably
imprisoned or punished. The abbot was left
with the printing material on his hands, which we may
suppose from the occurrence of his initials in the device
to have been at any rate partly his property. He therefore
transferred it to London for the use of his relative
until such time as Herford could resume work. This
Herford did in 1544, and Bourman transferred the
material back to him. After this Bourman’s name is
found in no book, though he was a member of the
Stationers’ Company and lived to the year 1560.</p>

<p>The death of Henry VIII. and the accession of
Edward VI. in 1547 gave a fresh impetus to printing,
and presses were set up in three new towns, Ipswich,
Worcester, and Canterbury. For some years previous
to this no book had been printed outside London, and
with the religious opinions changing from day to day,
even the London printers themselves hardly knew what
they might or might not issue without fear of prosecution.
Numbers of persons who had fled abroad returned, and
with them came an immense number of foreigners
seeking refuge from their own religious persecutions
abroad. As might be expected, the three new presses
were mainly devoted to printing books on the religious
questions then occupying the attention of the public.</p>

<p>At Ipswich, some years before printing was introduced
there, we find a book issued by a publisher. This
was an edition of the <i>Historia Evangelica</i> of Juvencus,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
and its imprint stated that it was to be sold at Ipswich
in 1534 by Reginald Oliver. A copy occurred in the
first part of Heber’s sale and was bought by Thorpe,
the bookseller, but since then all trace of it has disappeared.
The edition was probably that printed by
Joannes Graphaeus at Antwerp with Oliver’s imprint
added to a certain number of copies, and this is rendered
more likely by the fact that the same printer issued in
the same year an edition of the <i>Rudimenta-Grammatices</i>,
a school-book which had been prescribed in 1528 by
Cardinal Wolsey for use in the school which he had
just founded at Ipswich. Wolsey prescribed the use
of this book and others, not only for the use of his
special school at Ipswich, but throughout England,
and we find a number of editions printed at Antwerp
to be sent over to England for sale. Juvencus was
one of the authors whose book was recommended for use.</p>

<p>Of Reginald Oliver we hear nothing more. He
took out letters of denization in 1535 in which he is
described as “of Phrisia,” and is perhaps the Reynold
Oliver who translated a tract about an earthquake in
Mechlin in 1546 printed by Richard Lant.</p>

<p>As a stationer Oliver would be also a bookbinder,
and perhaps the panel stamp may be assigned to him
signed with the initials R. O. and a trade-mark. The
panel is divided by a vertical line into two halves each
filled by a large medallion. That on the right contains
the Tudor rose, the left the Royal arms. In the left-hand
upper corner is a shield with the cross of St George,
in the right the binder’s mark. If he had been a
London binder, this would have contained the city
arms. There is nothing to connect this binding with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
Oliver except the initials, but these are uncommon,
and no other stationer with them is known.</p>

<p>The first person to begin printing at Ipswich was a
certain Anthony Scoloker, whom most writers have
considered to be a foreigner, but who is definitely
spoken of in the Subsidy Rolls as an Englishman. He
was an educated man, printing translations of his own
from French and German, and it is not improbable
that he had left England on account of religious persecutions,
and had returned under the milder rule of
Edward. His settlement in Ipswich for a few months
may perhaps be traced to the influence of Richard
Argentine, a schoolmaster and physician of that town,
who was a vigorous reformer in the reign of Edward,
a violent Catholic in the time of Mary, and a penitent
Protestant again under Elizabeth, dying in 1568 as
rector of St Helen’s in Ipswich.</p>

<p>Of the seven books printed by Scoloker at Ipswich,
three were translations by himself, three by Argentine,
while the seventh was translated by Richard Rice,
Abbot of Conway. The first book issued was <i>The just
reckoning of the whole number of years to 1547</i> translated
by Scoloker from the German; of this an imperfect
copy is in the University Library. His two other
translations were <i>A Godly disputation between a shoemaker
and a parson</i>, of which there is a copy in a private
library, and <i>The Ordinary for all faithful Christians</i>.
Of this there is a copy in the Rylands Library. Argentine’s
three translations are Luther’s <i>Sermon upon
John xx. and the true use of the keys</i>, Ochino’s <i>Sermons</i>,
and Ulrich Zwingli’s <i>Certain precepts</i>. Copies of these
three books are not uncommon. The book translated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
by Rice was Hermann’s <i>Right Institution of
Baptism</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Just Reckoning</i> was translated by July 6, 1547,
and, we may presume, printed shortly afterwards, but
the remaining six books were all printed in the first five
months of 1548. The dates of the translations of the
three books by Argentine are January 28, January 30,
and February 13. At the end of Zwingli’s <i>Certain precepts</i>,
the earliest of Argentine’s translations, occurs
Scoloker’s device, a hand reaching from the clouds and
holding a coin to a touchstone inscribed “Verbum Dei.”
From the clouds in the left-hand corner a face, representing
the Holy Spirit, blows upon the stone. Below is
printed the text, “Prove the spirits whether they be of
God.”</p>

<p>Scoloker’s residence in Ipswich was a short one,
probably because he did not meet with sufficient encouragement,
and by June 1548 he was settled in
London, for a book by John Frith, dated June 30, was
issued by Anthony Scoloker and William Seres, dwelling
without Aldersgate. This was printed by Scoloker
and has his device on the last leaf. At London he
continued in business until at least 1550.</p>

<p>The next printer to be noticed is John Overton, if
indeed he ever existed, for it may be stated at once
that nothing is known of him but his name. This is
found in the colophon of Bale’s <i>Catalogue of British
Writers</i> from the time of Japhet, son of the most holy
Noah, up to the year 1548, which states explicitly that
the book was printed at Ipswich in England by John
Overton on July 31, 1548. On the other hand we
find on the title-page of a number of copies a no less<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
definite statement that the book was printed at Wesel
by Theodoricus Plateanus on July 31, 1548. One
thing is clear from an examination of the book itself,
and that is that it was certainly printed abroad, and
Bale himself, in the introduction which he wrote to John
Leland’s little book, entitled <i>The laborious journey and
search of John Leland</i>, writes, “Since I returned home
again from Germany where as I both collected and
emprinted my simple work <i>De Scriptoribus Britannicis</i>.”
Most writers have tried to make the two statements
agree by suggesting that the main body of the book
was printed abroad and brought over in sheets, and that
it was completed after its arrival with two sheets printed
by Overton at Ipswich. But these sheets unfortunately
are in exactly the same type as the rest of the
book. The Ipswich colophon occurs in all copies of
the book, but the Wesel imprint only in some. A
possible explanation may be found in the legal restrictions
regarding the importation of foreign books. As
regards copies sold abroad it would not matter where
they were printed, but imported copies might meet
with difficulties. Hence perhaps the Ipswich colophon
and the suppression of the Wesel imprint.</p>

<p>The suspicion which gathered round the book and
its imprints naturally spread to the printer himself,
Theodoricus Plateanus. Was he a real person or not?
Like John Overton, his name was only known from its
occurrence in this book, and it was often assumed to
be fictitious. A recent fortunate discovery made by
Mr Murray of Trinity has proved that he was a genuine
printer. Fragments of several books in Latin and
German were found used in the binding of an English<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
law-book, and on one of these was a colophon, dated
1548, the same date as Bale’s <i>De Scriptoribus</i>, “Drück
tho Wesel by Dirick van der straten,” and leaves of
Bale’s book were among the fragments. The discovery
is particularly fortunate, not only as supplying the
printer’s real name, which may enable us to trace him
further, but also as showing us new founts of type
undoubtedly used by him, and which were used also in
several foreign printed English books which up to now
could only be conjecturally assigned to certain towns
or presses. Besides the <i>De Scriptoribus Britannicis</i>
several other of Bale’s works can now be definitely
assigned to him.</p>

<p>The last of the three Ipswich printers and the most
important was John Oswen, perhaps from his name
and later connexion with Wales, a Welshman. He
printed in the town apparently only during the latter
half of 1548, but in that period issued ten if not more
books. These are all without exception works of the
reformers, Calvin, Oecolampadius, Melanchthon, and
others. Calvin is represented by two books, <i>A brief
declaration of the feigned sacrament</i>, and <i>A treatise on
what a faithful man ought to do dwelling among the papists</i>.
Of the latter book there is a copy in the University
Library, of the former no copy is at present known.</p>

<p>Melanchthon’s book <i>Of the true authoritie of the
Church</i>, and Oecolampadius’ <i>Epistle, that there ought
to be no respect of personages of the poor</i>, are both quoted
by Herbert though no copies seem to be known at
present.</p>

<p>Of the remaining six books, there are copies of
two in the University Library, bequeathed by Mr<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
Sandars. These are: <i>A new book containing an exhortation
to the sick</i>, of which another copy is in the
British Museum, and a curious little 16mo volume,
<i>An invectyve agaynst dronkennes</i>, of which the Cambridge
copy is the only one known. Several bibliographies
speak of it as a fragment, but though not in good condition
it wants only the last leaf which would have been
blank, or contained a device: all the text is complete.</p>

<p>There are copies of two other books in the library
of Clare College, Peter Moone’s <i>Short treatise of certain
things abused in the Popish church long used</i>, and John
Ramsey’s <i>Plaister for a galled horse</i>. Both these books
are rhyming attacks on the Catholics. There is another
copy of the first in the British Museum, but the two
leaves in the University Library which were supposed
to belong to this edition are really from the press of
William Copland in London. Of Ramsey’s book the
copy at Clare is the only one known, but another edition
was printed at London by Raynalde in the same year.
The next book is a translation of Anthony Marcourt’s
work, entitled, <i>A declaration of the Mass</i>; of this there
is a copy in the Bodleian, and finally there is another
issue of Hegendorff’s <i>Domestical or household sermons</i>,
of which there is a copy in the British Museum.</p>

</div>

<p>Oswen and Scoloker between them printed within
a year at least eighteen books at Ipswich, all of them
expounding the religious views of the reformers, and
examples of fourteen are known. Though there may
have been other inducements which caused these
printers to settle in that town, no doubt one of the
chief reasons was its accessibility to the Continent.
Numbers of English people who had fled abroad during
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>the religious troubles of Henry’s reign were pouring
back into the country, and many would pass through
Ipswich, and would purchase to carry with them for
their own use and for their friends copies of the books
which set forth the religious views for which they had
undergone such hardships, but which seemed at last
to be on the winning side. Again Ipswich, while easy
to get to, was equally easy to get away from, so that
perhaps discretion caused the printers to wait and
see how their books were received before they definitely
settled in an inland town.</p>

<p>Oswen, though he continued in business a few
months longer than Scoloker, seems also to have found
Ipswich an unremunerative centre for his work, and
towards the end of 1548, crossing with his material
from the east to the west of England, settled at Worcester.
On January 6, 2 Edward VI., that is at the
beginning of 1549, Oswen obtained a privilege from
the King to print “every kind of book or books set
forth by us concerning the service to be used in churches,
ministration of the sacraments, and instruction of our
subjects of the Principality of Wales and marches thereunto
belonging for seven years, prohibiting all other
persons whatsoever from printing the same.” What
this privilege definitely meant, or what use Oswen
made of it, is not clear. He certainly printed nothing
concerning the service of the church, or for the instruction
of the subjects, specially adapted to the
Principality of Wales. He printed editions of the
Prayer-book and New Testament, but they were in
English and varied in no respect from the editions put
forth by the authorised printers, Whitchurch and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
Grafton. The three or four Welsh books issued in the
vernacular during the period in which his privilege was
in force, Salisbury’s Dictionary in English and Welsh
and Introduction to Welsh pronunciation, extracts from
the laws of Hoel, and the Epistles and Gospels in Welsh,
books both for the instruction of the subject and the
service of the Church, were printed by other printers.
For these, or some of them, at any rate, privileges had
been obtained from Henry VIII. By the beginning of
1549 Oswen was settled in Worcester in the High Street,
issuing a book as early as January 30. Besides his
printing office in Worcester he appears to have had
another shop absolutely on the Welsh border, for at
the end of some of his colophons are the words: “They
be also to sell at Shrewsbury.”</p>

<p>Oswen’s four editions of the New Testament, from
1548 to 1550, as given by Herbert, seem to resolve themselves
into one quarto edition dated January 12, 1550.
Of the Prayer-book there were certainly three issues.
The first is a quarto dated May 24, 1549. It contains
an injunction which “streightly chargeth and commaundeth
that no maner of person do sell this present
boke unbounde, above the price of II Shillinges and
two pence ye piece. And the same bound in paste or
in boordes, not above the pryce of thre shillynges and
eyght pence the piece.” The next edition, a folio,
dated July 30, 1549, has a similar injunction fixing the
price at two shillings and sixpence unbound, and four
shillings bound. It will be noticed that His Highness’s
Council in their wisdom decreed that the cost of binding
a quarto and a folio should be exactly the same, namely
eighteen pence. The last issue, the rarest of all, was a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
folio printed in 1552. Apart from Prayer-books and
Testaments we know of seventeen books printed by
Oswen in the four years between 1549 and 1553. Seven
in 1549, five in 1550, three in 1551, and two in 1553.</p>

<p>The first book issued in 1549 was Henry Hart’s
<i>Consultorie for all Christians</i>. This is dated January
30, but is probably 1549 rather than 1550, since
the printer has printed at the beginning his newly-granted
privilege in full.</p>

<p>Six other books are dated 1549. Of these three,
Hegendorff’s <i>Household Sermons, The Dialogue between
the seditious anabaptist and the true Christian</i>, translated
by John Veron, and the <i>Spiritual Matrimony between
Christ and the Church</i>, are given by Herbert, but he had
apparently never seen copies and none are at present
known. Of <i>Certeyne sermons appointed by the King’s
majesty to be read</i>, there are two copies in the British
Museum. Herbert quotes <i>A message from King Edward
VI., concerning obedience to religion</i>, as printed by
Oswen at Worcester, August 5, 1549. This is apparently
another edition of the message “to certain of his people
assembled in Devonshire” printed by Grafton in July,
but addressed to the people of Wales.</p>

<p>The last of the year’s books was a <i>Psalter</i> printed in
red and black and issued on September 1, of which there
is a copy in the British Museum.</p>

<p>For the year 1550 there are four books, and of these
one St Ambrose, <i>Of opression</i>, said to be translated by
Oswen himself, is known only from the entry in Herbert,
derived from Maunsell’s catalogue. The other three,
Zwingli’s <i>Short pathway to the Scriptures</i>, <i>The godly
sayings of the old, ancient faithful fathers</i> translated by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
John Veron, and Gribald’s <i>Notable and marvellous
epistle</i>, are known, the first two from copies in the
University Library and elsewhere, the last from a
copy in the Bodleian. To the end of this year we may
ascribe a very rare little octavo, <i>Almanack and
prognostication for the year of our Lord</i> 1551. <i>Practised
by Simon Heringius and Lodowyke Boyard</i>. In April
1551 a new edition was issued of Bullinger’s <i>Dialogue
between the rebel Anabaptist and the true Christian</i>, which
is known from copies in the Bodleian and Brasenose
College Library. Herbert had quoted an earlier edition
of 1549, of which no copy is known and which is perhaps
due to some confusion with the present edition.
Bullinger’s <i>Most sure and strong defence of the baptism
of children</i>, translated by John Veron, was also issued
this year, and a copy is in the Bodleian. The third
and last book of 1551 was issued in May, Hooper’s
<i>Godly and most necessary annotations in the XIII. chapter
to the Romans</i>, of which there is a copy in the University
Library.</p>

<p>From May 1551 until May 1553, exactly two years,
no dated book is known from Oswen’s Worcester press,
except the folio Prayer-book of 1552. Nor is there any
undated book to be ascribed to these years, for Oswen’s
books, so far as we know, are all dated. This is another
of those unaccountable gaps that we so often find in the
career of a printer.</p>

<p>The last two Worcester books were issued in 1553,
a <i>Homily to be read in time of pestilence</i>, written by
Bishop Hooper and dated May 18, and the <i>Statutes of
the seventh year of Edward VI.</i> A copy of the <i>Homily</i>
is in the University Library. It is a handsomely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
printed thin quarto, and has on the title-page besides
four border-pieces, a woodcut of the Royal arms with
supporters, and another of the youthful king seated
on his throne. The <i>Statutes</i> are described by Herbert
from a copy in his own possession, but where it is at
present is not known.</p>

<p>Oswen printed altogether at Worcester some twenty-one
books, so that it heads the list of provincial presses
as regards numbers. The press is also noticeable for
the comparative excellence of the printing and the
variety of good border-pieces and initial letters, very
much superior to the material used by most of the
contemporary printers. From the class of books he
issued we can well understand the cessation of his press
as soon as Mary succeeded to the throne.</p>

<p>There remain three books to be noticed which
appear to be connected with Oswen. These are John
Sawtry’s <i>Defence of the marriage of priests</i>, another
book with a similar title by Philip Melanchthon, and
lastly a <i>Treatise of baptism and the Lord’s Supper</i>. The
colophon of the first runs: “Printed at Awryk by Jan
Troost, 1541 in August,” that of the second, “Printed
at Lipse by Ubryght Hoff,” while the title-page says,
“Translated out of latyne into englisshe by Lewes
Beuchame in the yere of the Lorde 1541 in August.”
The colophon of the last runs: “At Grunning 1541
April 27.” The three books are obviously from the
same press; initials, borders, type, all agree, and
copies are in some cases bound together. They are
no less obviously printed in England, but by whom?
The only clue so far is an initial M which appears identical
with one used by Oswen, while on the other hand the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
borders do not occur in any of Oswen’s books though
he uses a large selection. Again, why should all three
books be dated 1541 which, if they were the work of
Oswen, must be a false date. Though admitting the
clue which connects them with Oswen, it would be safer
for the present until more evidence is forthcoming to
class them under “printer unidentified.”</p>

<p>At present, though a good start has been made in
the Catalogue of Early English Books in the University
Library, a very great deal remains to be done, and if
done at all to be done very carefully, on the subject
of books with fictitious imprints or with none at all.
Hitherto if there was anything the least strange in the
appearance of a book, or if its subject were of a controversial
nature, it was promptly docketed “printed
at a secret press on the Continent.” That many such
books were printed at Continental presses is quite clear,
but in the majority of cases any danger in connexion
with such books was not to the printer, but to the
person who introduced them into this country. In
consequence the foreign printers rarely tried to deceive,
and once their types are properly identified, it is not
difficult to ascribe foreign printed books to their right
printers. But on the other hand, I suspect that a
considerable number of books now generally ascribed
to Continental presses were really produced in this
country. The wording of various enactments against
seditious books makes it clear that the authorities of
the period at any rate considered that numbers were
printed in this country, and if that is so we must look
for them outside the ordinary and known productions
of our regular printers. If we take away all the unsigned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
books which may be clearly ascribed to foreign
presses, a very large number will still remain about
which we know, for the present at any rate, little or
nothing.</p>

<p>Canterbury was the last of the provincial towns to
start a press, and its first book was an edition of the
<i>Psalter</i> printed in 1549. One or two early writers,
however, quoted a book printed there about 1525.
The title runs: <i>A goodly narration how St Augustine the
Apostle of England raysed two dead bodies at Longcompton,
collected out of divers authors, translated by John Lidgate,
Monke of Bury</i>. Printed at St Austens at Canterburie
in 4to. No copy of the book is at present known, but
it is conjectured that, like another book connected with
Canterbury, <i>The history of King Boccus and Sydracke</i>,
it may have been printed by a London printer, “at
the coste and charge of Dan Robert Saltwoode, monke
of St Austen’s at Cantorbery.”</p>

<p>John Mychell, the first printer, seems to have begun
his career in London, where he printed two books, the
<i>Life of St Margaret</i> and the <i>Life of St Gregory’s mother</i>,
at a printing office with a long and interesting history,
<i>The long shop in the Poultry</i>. He probably worked
there between the tenancies of Richard Kele, who left
it in 1546, and his apprentice Alde, who worked there
later. Mr Allnutt, in an article on Provincial Presses,
asserts that he quitted Canterbury for London in the
reign of Queen Mary and quotes these two books as
proof, but that would mean that he came to London
after 1555, in which case we might expect to find some
mention of him in the Stationers’ Registers, and at
that time, too, the long shop in the Poultry was occupied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
by another printer. I think it may be taken for certain
that he went from London to Canterbury.</p>

<p>Mychell’s first Canterbury book, the <i>Psalter or
psalms of David after the translation of the great Bible</i>,
printed in 1549, is an extremely rare book. The only
copy quoted by bibliographers is one which was in Dr
Lort’s sale in 1791. This copy passed to Lord Spencer
and is now in the Rylands Library. It was reissued
again in 1550 and a copy is in the University Library.
The only known copy of the other book issued in 1550,
John Lamberd’s <i>Treatise of predestination</i>, is also in
the University Library. In 1552 and 1553 there were
at least three issues of a <i>Breviat Chronicle</i> compiled or
at any rate edited by Mychell himself.</p>

<p>The nine undated books which he issued were mainly
theological and controversial. One of these, entitled
<i>Newes from Rome concerning the blasphemous sacrifice
of the papisticall Masse</i>, was printed for E. Campion.
It is curious, considering the title of the book, that
this E. Campion was in all probability the London
bookseller of the time, Edmund Campion, the father
of the celebrated Jesuit martyr.</p>

<p>Two others are quoted by Herbert, <i>A short epistle
to all such as do contempne the marriage of us poor preestes</i>
and <i>The spirituall matrimonye betweene Chryste, and
the Soul</i>, no copies of either being at present known,
though a title-page of the second is among the Bagford
fragments.</p>

<p>Mychell printed also an edition of Stanbridge’s
<i>Accidence</i>, of Lidgate’s <i>Churl and Bird</i>, and of Robert
Saltwood’s <i>Comparison between four birds</i>. Saltwood
was keeper of the chapel of the Virgin Mary at Canterbury<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
when on December 4, 1539, he signed the surrender.
His name is not found after this nor does he appear in
the list of pensioners. He seems to have taken an
interest in poetry, and it was for him that the <i>Boccus
and Sydracke</i> was printed, so perhaps we may trace
to his instigation the separate works of Lidgate which
Mychell printed. In the colophon to his own book
Saltwood is described only as monk, with no mention
of Canterbury, and the place of printing is not stated,
so that it may have been issued by Mychell at London.</p>

<p>Mary’s succession seems to have caused the cessation
of the press, and certainly the class of theological works,
which had been its main output, was not such as would
be received with favour under the changed conditions.</p>

<p>Mychell, however, still remained at Canterbury,
though his press was idle. The only piece of printing
that can be assigned to him after Mary’s accession is
a semi-official tract of four leaves. <i>Articles to be
enquyred in thordinary visitacion of the most reverende
father in God, the Lorde Cardinall Pooles grace Archebyshop
of Caunterbury wythin hys Dioces of Cantorbury.
In the yeare of our Lorde God M. V. C. Lvi.</i> Pole was
only consecrated Archbishop in March 1556, so that
the pamphlet must have been printed after that date.
No perfect copy is known, but the first and last leaves,
which belonged to Herbert and which he described in
his <i>Typographical Antiquities</i>, are now in the Douce
Collection in the Bodleian. The pamphlet is unique
in another respect, as it is the only piece of provincial
printing in England issued during Mary’s reign.</p>

<p>Ames in his <i>History of Printing</i>, published in 1749,
mentions two books printed for Martin Coffin, a stationer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
living at Exeter. The first, an edition of Stanbridge’s
<i>Vocabula</i>, was printed at Rouen by Lawrence Hostingue
and Jamet Loys. This would put the date about 1505
when these two printers were in partnership and before
1508 when Hostingue left Rouen.</p>

<p>The other book is an edition of <i>Catho cum commento</i>,
also printed at Rouen by Richard Goupil who was at
work about 1510. This is also mentioned in Bagford’s
notes. The first of these books was sold in Thomas
Rawlinson’s sale where Ames probably saw it, and the
second may perhaps have been bound up with it, but
since that sale in 1727 all traces of them have
disappeared.</p>

<p>Martin Coffin remained some time longer in England,
for we find him taking out letters of denization in the
year 1524 on April 28, and in these he is described as
a bookbinder.</p>

<p>Lastly we may notice two books printed abroad
which, by having the names of English towns printed
in their colophons, have sometimes been considered
as the productions of English provincial presses. The
earlier of the two is <i>The Rescuyinge of the Romish Fox</i>
written by William Turner under the pseudonym of
William Wraghton. The book is a violent attack
on Stephen Gardiner, then Bishop of Winchester, and
ends with the colophon: “Imprinted have at Winchester.
Anno Domini, 1545. By me Hanse Hit Prik.” The
obvious meaning is that the fictitious Hans Hitprik
has imprinted the book against the bishop, not at the
town, of Winchester. Nevertheless the book has been
quoted over and over again as a Winchester printed
book.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span></p>

<p>The second book is Luther’s <i>Faythfull admonycion
of a certen true pastor</i>, with the colophon, “Imprinted
at Grenewych by Conrade Freeman in the month of
May 1554. With the most gracious licence and
privilege of God almighty, King of heaven and earth.”
This last sentence is quite enough to show the nature
of the work, and that the name of the place and printer
are alike fictitious.</p>

<p>Both books are apparently from the press of
Christopher Froschover at Zurich, a prolific printer of
controversial books.</p>

<p>In Seyer’s <i>Memoirs of Bristol</i>, published in 1823,
the claim was put forward for the existence of an early
press at Bristol on the strength of extracts from some
manuscript Kalendars to the effect that “In the year
1546 a press for printing was set up in the castle which
is used daily to the honour of God.” No trace of anything
printed at Bristol in the sixteenth century has
been found, and perhaps the date quoted may be an
error for 1646, about which time a press was certainly
at work in the town issuing sermons and other tracts.</p>

<p>When we consider the places where presses were at
work during this period, or where stationers lived who
commissioned books, it seems surprising that other
towns of equal or greater importance have nothing
to show printed or published in them. So much that
has come down to us has survived by so slender a
chance that there is always the hope that further information
may be found and other towns added to our
list. Hereford is only represented in a colophon by
the unique copy of one book, Exeter by two books
which have been lost for over a hundred and fifty years.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span></p>

<p>Chester, for example, is a town where we might
have expected to find books printed or published. The
stationers there were certainly important, for they
formed themselves along with the heraldic painters
and embroiderers into a company which obtained a
charter from the Mayor and Aldermen on the feast of
St Philip and St James in 1534, formally enrolled in
1536. After some trouble I ran the registers of the
Company to earth, but unfortunately the first volume
has been lost, so that the records between the years
1536 and 1587 are missing, and any information about
the period we are now concerned with, irrecoverable
at present.</p>

<p>Chester was the centre of a large and important
district, and was also the chief port of embarkation for
Ireland (it was from there that Edward King set out
on his ill-fated voyage), so that we might well expect
its stationers to have published something, or some
printer to have set up a press. And there are many
other towns in a similar position. We know from
records that they supported a number of stationers,
and it is hard to believe that nothing was printed for
them, even an almanack.</p>

<p>Within the period we have been examining, roughly
the hundred years since the invention of printing up
to the passing of the Stationers’ Company’s Charter in
1557, printing had been practised in nine provincial
towns. The two fifteenth-century presses, Oxford
and St Alban’s, ceased simultaneously in 1486. York,
away in the north of England, had a press at work
between 1509 and 1516. Then comes a curious revival;
a second press at Oxford from 1517 to 1519, a press at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
Cambridge in 1521 and 1522, at Tavistock in 1525
and 1534, at Abingdon in 1528, and a second at St
Alban’s from 1534 to 1538. Then came the Reformation
and the accompanying changes in the old order
of things after which not one of the old presses ventured
to start again. The accession of Edward VI. seems
to have given a new impetus to book-production, and
the remaining three of the early provincial presses
were started during his reign, Ipswich working in 1547
and 1548, Worcester from 1548 to 1553, and Canterbury
from 1549 to 1556.</p>

<p>When we come to sum up the books produced, it
must be admitted that the output was miserably
small. Between 1478 and 1556 the provincial presses of
England issued about one hundred and eleven books,
not three books in two years; twenty-one more books
were printed for provincial stationers, bringing up the
number to one hundred and thirty-two, not two books a
year. Between 1478 and 1516, thirty books were printed
in three towns; between 1517 and 1538, twenty-six in
five towns; and between 1548 and 1556, fifty-five books
in three towns. The output of many foreign provincial
towns far surpassed that of all the English put together.</p>

<p>But in looking at the history of the book trade in
England during the period, one point is especially
striking, the very great disproportion between the
numbers of printers and of stationers. The books produced
by the English presses formed but an infinitesimal
portion of the literature circulated in the country.
The number of printers we can reckon fairly accurately,
for there must be few, if any, who have left no trace;
with stationers it is quite otherwise, for we are almost
entirely dependent on records and registers, of which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
vast numbers have utterly perished. In these early
times, fortunately for us, if unfortunately for themselves,
people seem to have been continually engaged
in lawsuits, and it is from records of law pleas and
actions that much of our information is derived, though
often it consists of mere names.</p>

<p>It is very difficult for us now to arrive at a clear
conception of the position of a stationer or the character
of the book trade of that period. Reading and
writing were not very common accomplishments,
books were relatively expensive and purchasers must
have been few, yet in a small town like Bury St
Edmund’s we find about the year 1505 no fewer than
six stationers. We know the names of six, there may
have been more, yet how were even six to earn a livelihood?
The trade of a stationer then was more comprehensive
than now, for he was a bookseller and a bookbinder,
but even then his business cannot have been
large and would hardly be sufficient to keep him. It
is clear, however, from numerous contemporary references,
that stationers often engaged in other business
apart from their own. We find them dealing in various
things besides books, but by far the most favourite
occupation supplementary to selling books was to keep
a public-house. Numbers of the early stationers are
spoken of also as beer brewers. In the Oxford University
Archives we constantly find licences granted to
the booksellers to sell wine or beer. The early English
printer, Jean Barbier, who had worked at London and
Westminster at the end of the fifteenth century, is
cited in a London lawsuit as “Johannes Barbour
nuper de Coventre, bere brewer, alias dictus Jehanne
Berbier nuper de Coventre, prenter.” Anthony de<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
Solen, the first printer at Norwich, was admitted a freeman
of that city on the condition “that he shall not
occupye eny trade of marchandise eyther from the parts
beyonde the seas or from London, but onely his arte
of prynting and selling of Renysh wyne.” References
to this dual business are very frequent, and it seems
to have continued as late as the seventeenth century.</p>

<p>The importation of foreign books into England
during the end of the fifteenth and early part of the
sixteenth centuries must have been very large. The
revival of learning was setting in, the country was
gaining a reputation for scholarship and attracting
foreign students, and every encouragement was given
by the authorities to the book trade. In the grant given
to Peter Actors, he was allowed to import books without
paying customs, so that there was some tax upon
imported books, though it was probably very slight.</p>

<p>For almost every class of book of a learned character
the English purchaser was dependent on the foreign
printer, and English scholars as a rule sent their own
works to the Continent to be printed on account of the
greater facilities and probably also for the lesser cost.</p>

<p>The two classes of tradesmen who dealt in books
were well described by Fuller in the seventeenth century.
The one he calls “stationarii, publickly avouching the
sale of staple books in standing shops, whence they
have their names,” the other he designates “circumforanean
pedlers, ancestors to our modern Mercuries
and hawkers.” No doubt, as on the Continent, the
stationer was accustomed to send round periodically
a van laden with books from town to town, and village
to village, and, putting up at the village inn, advertise
and show his wares there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span></p>

<p>The chief opportunity for selling books was at the
various fairs, and to these the agents of the London
booksellers would journey, not only to sell books to
the public, but to do wholesale business with the local
stationers. It is quite clear that a large number of
important foreign printers and publishers kept premises
in London, and their representatives would also be
present at the fairs. These fairs were very important
centres of trade. They continued for a week, sometimes
two, and while they continued, the ordinary
shops of the town were compelled to close. There is
evidence to show that to the principal fairs many of
the London booksellers went themselves, leaving their
shops in charge of an assistant. In 1487 an attempt was
made by the Corporation of London to prevent London
freemen attending local fairs, but a general outcry
was made that many goods, amongst them books,
would not be obtainable, and the ordinance was repealed.
The subject of the book trade at fairs is too
large to be considered here, but it must be remembered
that by far the largest fair in England, a not unworthy
rival to Frankfurt, was held at Sturbridge by Cambridge,
and it retained its reputation for bookselling for some
centuries.</p>

<p>After the first quarter of the sixteenth century
the freedom of the foreign book trade was menaced by
many ominous acts culminating in the act of 1534,
which seriously interfered with the sale of foreign
books and the trade of the foreign stationer, and about
the same time the disuse and suppression of the various
service books destroyed another branch of the trade.</p>

<p>The book trade received a further severe blow from
the literary side by the advent in England of what was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
contemptuously styled by many of the old scholars
with distrust and dislike, the “New Learning,” the
teachings of Luther, Melanchthon, and the reformers.
The revival of learning and classical study which had
given so great an impetus to the book trade was superseded
by religious and doctrinal quarrelling, which,
though for a time encouraging the importation of controversial
pamphlets, soon brought down upon all
concerned the heavy hand of authority, with the result
that, while the literature of the “New Learning” was prohibited,
the demand for books of other classes had ceased.</p>

<p>The last twenty years of Henry VIII.’s reign was
an anxious time for printers and booksellers; it seemed
impossible to foretell what might safely be printed.
Books which one year were condemned to be burnt
appeared a couple of years afterwards, “cum privilegio
regali.” During these years, therefore, we find the
provincial press almost entirely unrepresented: between
1538 and 1548 not a single book was printed, at any
rate overtly, and in the ten years before that, hardly
half a dozen. As we have seen, the short reign of
Edward VI. saw more books printed in the provincial
towns than had been produced since the invention of
printing, but this fruitful time was short.</p>

<p>The accession of Mary was marked by an outpouring
of seditious books which naturally did not please the
ruling powers. Several enactments were issued against
them, seemingly with little effect. Finally, in 1557,
Philip and Mary, “considering and manifestly perceiving
that several seditious and heretical books, both
in verse and prose, are daily published, stamped and
printed by divers scandalous, schismatical, and heretical
persons, not only exciting our subjects and liegemen to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
sedition and disobedience against us, our crown and
dignity, but also to the renewal and propagating very
great and detestable heresies against the faith and
sound catholic doctrine of holy mother the church,”
determined upon a decisive step. The weapon they
forged was ingenious. They granted a Charter to the
Stationers’ Company forbidding anyone to print who
did not belong to it. The stationers were naturally
active in putting down anything which competed with
themselves, while the King and Queen could in their
turn keep a firm grasp on the stationers. The various
enactments of the Stationers’ Charter practically put
an end to the provincial book trade.</p>

<p>In my brief survey of the subject I hope I have
at any rate shown some of the many points of interest
with which it abounds. It is one moreover eminently
associated with the name of Mr Sandars. The provincial
presses always had a great attraction for him,
and to his liberality the University Library is indebted
for many of the specimens it possesses.</p>

<p>Perhaps what may have struck you most is how
much we have yet to learn on the subject, how little we
really know. A good deal of what has been said has
been, not about books which we now possess, but
about books which we have lost. A cloud of obscurity
still hangs over the subject, but the cloud has a silver
lining. Think how much there still remains for us to
discover.</p>
